## storage:
##
## If storage.[type].existingClaim is defined, a Persistent Volume Claim must
## exist with that name. If an existingClaim is specified, storageClass and
## storageSize are not used.
##
## If storage.[type].storageClass is defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)
##
## storage.[type].forcePermissions=true is required by some types of provisioned
## storage, where the mounted filing system has insufficient permissions to be
## read by the hpcc pods. Examples include using hostpath storage (e.g. on
## minikube and docker for desktop), or using NFS mounted storage.
