//       match the offset of the node in the file.
//       This also means there is no benefit in passing in a hash code - because it will not match the hash calculated
//       by the node cache, unless the hash algorithm is refactored.  (May be worth exploring).
//       Any hash code calculated by the cache can be saved in the reservation to avoid recalculating it on write().

// It is relatively unlikely, but there may be concurrent nodeUsed(), readOrReserve() and write calls for the same offset
// (e.g. 3 different nodes may be being accessed within the same "page").  Ideally a second readOrRequest() for the same
// page should block until the first has succeeded (or the reservation is released).
//
// Size is not provided on any of the calls, because the disk page cache only caches items of a fixed size.
// If a read from a file is not a multiple of the page size it is the caller's responsibility to zero fill if necessary
// before inserting into the cache.
