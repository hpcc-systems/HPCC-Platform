1. Compile
    (1) Enter the directory that contains this file and all the source files.
    (2) Type in "gmake" to build release mode. Use "gmake DEBUG" to build debug mode.
    (3) Release mode files will be under the "release" directory (within the source directory). There're 4
        directories - include, lib, bin and obj. The include directory contains zcrypt.hpp, lib directory 
        contains libzcrypt.a and bin directory contains zcrypttest. 
        Debug mode files will be under "debug" directory, and the sub directories are similar to release mode.
    (4) to clean up, use "gmake clean"

2. Use the library.
    To use the library, you only need zcrypt.hpp and libzcrypt.a.
    You'll find an example to use it in main.cpp (from which zcrypttest is built).

    Several things to pay attention to -
    (1) When error happens, the library throws string type exception, so you should put the calls within 
        a try catch block.
    (2) Tracelevel is an integer. By default is set to 0, which means no tracing. If set to 1, it only prints
        errors and warnings, set to 6 it will print some tracing, set to 11 or bigger it will print more
        tracing info. All tracing goes to stdout.
    (3) the encrypt() function takes references of IZBuffer* type as input. The pointers will be allocated within
        the function. 
        After using them, they need to be released with releaseIZ function. The IZEncryptor* object also need to 
        be released with releaseIZ, after you've done all the encryption work.


    #include "zcrypt.hpp"
    
    .....

    try
    {
        IZEncryptor* zc = createZEncryptor(pubkeystr);
        zc->setTraceLevel(atoi(argv[2]));

        IZBuffer* buf = NULL;
        IZBuffer* key = NULL;
        zc->encrypt(inlen, din, key, buf);
        releaseIZ(key);
        releaseIZ(buf);
        releaseIZ(zc);
    }
    catch(string str)
    {
        printf("%s\n", str.c_str());
    }
    
3. Use the test proggram.
    usage: zcrypttest <file-to-encrypt> <trace-level> <iteration-times>
