This file contains a list of numbers used to indentify components to
jlog. You should #define LOGMSGCOMPONENT as the appropriate value (or
use the project settings or makefile to do this).

(Naturally, since removing or changing existing numbers could break
existing code, you should be careful about doing so.)

If you exceed MSGCOMP_NUMBER components (i.e. if the highest number
used equals this value) then you will need to edit that #define in
system/jlib/jlog.cpp.

Current value of MSGCOMP_NUMBER: 1000
