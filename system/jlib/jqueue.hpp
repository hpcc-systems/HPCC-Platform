/*
 * The ReaderWriterQueue is a bounded inter-thread queue that aims to be lock free when adding an item to the queue
 * if there is space, and removing items from a non empty queue.
 * Normally lock free implementations may be unbounded - which can cause memory to be exhausted if the producers
 * are faster than the consumer.  They also tend to spin until they can proceed - but this performs poorly if the
 * consumer and producer are not perfectly balanced.  The high level of contention can also cause cache issues.
 *
 * This implementations will wait on a semaphore if there is no room, or if the queue is empty.
 * It uses a single state field which combines information about the queue state and the number of waiting readers/writers.
 *
 * The queue also has support for
 *   aborting - causing all consumers and producers to fail to enqueue/dequeue
 *   noting writers have completed.  This is particularly useful consumers of a M:1 queue knowing there will be no more items.
