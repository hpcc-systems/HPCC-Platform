To build for Linux:
-------------------

1. Check out sources (for example, to directory ~/hpcc)
2. Create a build directory - either as a child of hpcc or elsewhere
3. cd to the build directory
4a.To create makefiles to build native release version for local machine, run
cmake ~/hpcc
4b.To create makefiles to build native debug version, run
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ~/hpcc
4c.To create makefiles to build 32-bit version from 64-bit host, run
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-m32 -march=i386" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-m32 -march=i386" ~/hpcc
5. To build the makefiles just created above, run
make
6. Executables will be created in ./<releasemode>/bin and ./<releasemode>/libs
7. To create a .deb / ,rpm to install, run
make package

 
To build for Windows:
---------------------

1. Check out sources (for example, to directory c:\hpcc)
2. Create a build directory - either as a child of hpcc or elsewhere
3. cd to the build directory
4. To create a Visual Studio project, run
cmake c:\hpcc -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
The sln file hpccsystems-platform.sln will be created in the current directory, and will support debug and release targets
5. To build the project, load the solution into the visual studio IDE and build in the usual way.
6. Executables will be created in (for example) c:\hpcc\bin\<release_mode>

To build client tools for Macintosh OSX:
----------------------------------------

1. Check out sources (for example, to directory ~/hpcc)
2. You many need to install some 3rd-party dev packages using macports
3. Create a build directory - either as a child of hpcc or elsewhere
4. cd to the build directory
5. Use clang to build the clienttools (gcc4.2 cores when compiling some of the sources):
CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ cmake ~/hpcc -DCLIENTTOOLS_ONLY
5. To build the makefiles just created above, run
make
6. Executables will be created in ./<releasemode>/bin and ./<releasemode>/libs
7. To create a .dmg to install, run
make package
