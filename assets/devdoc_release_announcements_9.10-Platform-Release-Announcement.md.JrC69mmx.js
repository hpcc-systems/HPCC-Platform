This exciting new release, version 9.10.0, provides many enhancements to lower cloud costs, improve performance, and provide a better user experience. Additionally, the latest release now includes all plug-ins, eliminating the need for any separate plug-in installations.</p><h2 id="highlights" tabindex="-1">Highlights <a class="header-anchor" href="#highlights" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Highlights&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Cloud Cost savings</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Performance (Thor)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Performance (Roxie)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Logging</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient File Copy on Cloud Deployments</strong><br> Traditional DFU Server file transfers involve reading files block-by-block from the source and writing them block-by-block to the destination. This approach not only ties up cluster resources but also incurs costs for each block read and written, as well as for ingress and egress bandwidth.</p><p>By offloading the copying of files hosted on storage planes to cloud providers, we can achieve greater efficiency. Major cloud providers offer storage services with APIs that facilitate file transfers between storage locations. Some APIs even support transfers between different cloud providers. For instance, Azure&#39;s API allows data transfers between Azure storage and Amazon S3 buckets.</p><p>These API-driven file transfers are typically more efficient and cost-effective than traditional DFU Server transfers. HPCC Systems now supports API copy for Azure Blob Storage and Azure File Shares.</p></li></ul>',4)]))}const u=n(r,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
