We will upgrade to the latest point release for the library that fixes the security issue. c) For the cloud any security fixes in the base image or the packages installed in that image.</p><p>If there are no changes in any of those areas for a particular version then a new point release will not be created.</p><p>If you are deploying a system to the cloud you have one of two options</p><p>a) Use the images that are automatically built and published as part of the build pipeline. This image is currently based on ubuntu 22.04 and contains the majority of packages users will require.</p><p>b) Use your own hardened base image, and install the containerized package that we publish into that image.</p><h2 id="package-versions" tabindex="-1">Package versions. <a class="header-anchor" href="#package-versions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Package versions.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We currently generate the following versions of the package and images:</p><ul><li>debug</li><li>release with symbols</li><li>release without symbols.</li></ul><p>It is recommended that you deploy the &quot;release with symbols&quot; version to all bare-metal and non-production cloud deployments. The extra symbols allow the system to generate stack backtraces which make it much easier to diagnose problems if they occur. The &quot;release without symbols&quot; version is recommended for Kubernetes production deployments. Deploying a system without symbols reduces the size of the images. This reduces the time it takes Kubernetes to copy the image before provisioning a new node.</p>',51)]))}const m=t(r,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
