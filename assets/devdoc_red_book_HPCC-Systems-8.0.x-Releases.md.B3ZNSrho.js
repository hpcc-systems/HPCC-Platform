If you encounter this error, install the appropriate JDK for your Ubuntu distro or the <code>openjdk-devel</code> package for Centos.</p><p><a href="https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/browse/HPCC-25879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HPCC-25879</a></p><p><strong>Roxie worker threads were incorrectly given elevated priority if started on demand</strong></p><p>In HPCC Systems 8.0.x series, an issue which could cause CPU starvation or other difficult to predict effects has been fixed. In this case, ROXIE was not operating as intended. While there is a workaround available for earlier versions of HPCC Systems which involves setting the <code>prestartAgentThreads</code> option to true in the ROXIE configuration, it is now fixed and more details are available in this JIRA issue:</p><p><a href="https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/browse/HPCC-25493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HPCC-25493</a></p>',20)]))}const p=t(o,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
