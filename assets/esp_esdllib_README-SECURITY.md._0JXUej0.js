The HPCC platform includes a number of security managers, and your deployment may include additional managers accessed via separately installed plugins.</p><h2 id="identify-the-required-security-data" tabindex="-1">Identify the Required Security Data <a class="header-anchor" href="#identify-the-required-security-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Identify the Required Security Data&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After choosing a security manager, it is necessary to tell the ESP which of the manager&#39;s user data will be used by the service.</p><p>The ESP uses resources to map developer-defined names to manager-defined values. A developer-assigned name is mapped to a manager-defined key, and the manager uses the key to locate the value. These resources are combined into resource maps based on the type of resource, either a location, a feature, or a setting.</p><p><em>A resource&#39;s developer-assigned name may match the manager-defined key, but this is neither required nor assured. No two managers are guaranteed to identify the same value using the same name. A manager may require additional context to look up a value than can be conveyed by a name alone. For these reasons, it is normal for a unique definition to be provided for each service and security manager pairing.</em></p><h3 id="location" tabindex="-1">Location <a class="header-anchor" href="#location" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Location&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Configured in Authenticate/Location, a location resource identifies a permission required to access specific service URL paths.

At least one such resource must be configured and successfully authorized by the security manager for any additional security to be applied.

</code></pre><p>Example 2 demonstrates alternative markup to produce the same security requirements. By adding the method-specific requirement to the service annotation, methods with requirements that conform to a naming convention may omit the annotation altogether.

When added to an <code>Binding/Defintion/Methods/Method</code> element, the indicated features are applied to that method alone.</p><p>The attribute values generally behave in the same manner as the ESDL definition&#39;s annotation values. As the <code>ESPmethod</code> annotation can ignore or override requirements defined by its predecessor, the <code>ESPservice</code>, the <code>Binding/Definition</code> attribute can ignore or override requirements defined by its predecessors, starting with the <code>ESPmethod</code>, and the <code>Binding/Definition/Methods/Method</code> attribute can ignore or override requirements defined by its predecessors, starting with <code>Binding/Definition</code>.</p><p><em>Example 3: Override of the ESDL definition</em></p><pre><code>&lt;Binding&gt;
