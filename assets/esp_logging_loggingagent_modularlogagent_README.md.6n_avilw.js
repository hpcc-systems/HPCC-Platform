Support for multiple types of logging (e.g., writing to a file versus updating a database), requires either a plugin for each type or a monolithic agent that tries to do everything. In an effort to reduce the proliferation of plugins, this plugin uses a new monolithic log agent modular framework. Rather than expecting a single class to do everything, the framework breaks down agent functionality into a set of small and possibly reusable components referred to as modules. Access to customer-agnostic implementations of functionality is provided through this plugin. Access to customer-centric implementations should not be included in this plugin; one or more proprietary plugins should be developed to address those requirements.</p><p>A logging manager finds occurrences of <strong>LogAgent</strong> within its configuration. Each instance includes a number of properties which can be separated into two categories. Properties defined and used by this agent&#39;s framework, i.e., properties that distinguish this agent from others, are referred to as <em>modular</em> properties. Properties common to many agents and used by the broader logging engine are referred to as <em>agent integration</em> properties.</p><p>This document describes how to configure an instance of the plugin for use within the overall logging framework. The intended audience is configuration authors, i.e., individuals responsible for creating configurations using a deployed plugin as opposed to developers maintaining or extending the plugin. Because no previous plugin has required a manual configuration, as this does, limited attention will be given to <em>agent integration</em> properties, but the document&#39;s focus is on the definition and use of <em>modular</em> properties.</p><p>A convention used in the document is that within each section that describes a module, one or more subsections are included that contain quoted text in the section heading. These quoted text strings are the plugin-defined selectors used by the plugin to create the configured module implementations. Each module configuration includes an optional <em>module</em> attribute that is used to select an implementation. If the attribute is omitted or empty, the <em>default</em> implementation is selected. A configuration requesting any <em>module</em> value other than those described here is invalid.</p><h3 id="modules" tabindex="-1">Modules <a class="header-anchor" href="#modules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modules&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="logagent" tabindex="-1">LogAgent <a class="header-anchor" href="#logagent" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;LogAgent&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The only module that is required to use the plugin is <strong>LogAgent</strong>. This module provides access to all log agent service functionality. Implementations may be monolithic, including all agent functionality within one class. Alternate implementations may themselves be modular, relying upon smaller, more focused service modules to provide interchangeable functionality.</p><p>Monolithic implementations are permitted when they provide the best solution for logging requirements. One plugin may still be configured for multiple types of logging. Modular implementations are preferred due to increased flexibility and reuse.</p><h5 id="default" tabindex="-1">&quot;default&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#default" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;default&quot;&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The default implementation relies upon separate service module implementations for each supported agent service. The use of service modules increases plugin flexibility, especially as the list of supported services expands.</p><p>Configuring a supported service module implicitly enables that service. Alternatively, to support YAML property files, a default service module implementation may be requested with a Boolean property in place of an empty element. Omission of a service module configuration explicitly disables that service.</p><p>Of the defined log agent services, only one - UpdateLog - is supported. Support for the remaining services will be added in future updates.</p><h5 id="mock" tabindex="-1">&quot;mock&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#mock" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;mock&quot;&quot;">​</a></h5><p>A mocked agent can be configured to produce any response that another agent may produce, with no depenencies on input or external sources. Each service for which the configuration defines a response is enabled. Each service for which the configuration does not define a response is disabled.</p><p>Although intended primarily for use with unit tests, exposing the module through the plugin causes no harm and may provide value for testing that is not part of the unit tests.</p><h4 id="updatelog" tabindex="-1">UpdateLog <a class="header-anchor" href="#updatelog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;UpdateLog&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Implementations of the <strong>UpdateLog</strong> service module provide log update request processing. Implementations may be monolithic, handling update requests from end to end. Alternate implementations may themselves be modular, separating generic functionality from implementation details associated with various forms of persistence (e.g., database, file, or web service updates).</p><p>The input to this module will be log content data supplied to the log agent by the log thread. All data transformations may assume this as a starting point. However, the existence of content filters in the manager and agent configurations, as well as custom transformations in the transactional ESP, may radically alter the input. It is the configuration author&#39;s responsibility to ensure that meets expectations.</p><h5 id="default-1" tabindex="-1">&quot;default&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#default-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;default&quot;&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The default implementation relies upon separate <strong>Target</strong> delegate module implementations to persist data prepared by the service module. This creates a logical distinction between the preparation of data to be persisted, which is the responsibility of this module, and the persistence of data, which is the responsibility of <strong>Target</strong> modules. It separates the generic manipulation of update request data from the details of persisting the data.</p><p>Each target has expectations of the data provided by the service module. It is the configuration author&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the data prepared by the configured service module meets the requirements of the configured delegate module.</p><p>Configuring a delegate module implicitly enables data persistence. Omission of a target module configuration limits data persistence to conditional inclusion in trace log output.</p><h4 id="target" tabindex="-1">Target <a class="header-anchor" href="#target" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Target&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Implementations of the <strong>Target</strong> delegate module interface persist data supplied by an <strong>UpdateLog</strong> service module. Three data inputs may be provided to each instance, including the complete update request (the <em>original</em> input), the possible output of custom transformations applied to the complete update request (the <em>intermediate</em> input), and the possible output of an XSL transformation applied to either of the first two inputs (the <em>final</em> input). Each implementation defines which inputs it uses and how it uses them. It is the configuration author&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the <strong>UpdateLog</strong> module produces the inputs required by the implementation.</p><h5 id="default-2" tabindex="-1">&quot;default&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#default-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;default&quot;&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The default implementation accepts all content and conditionally adds it to trace log output. This functionality is provided as a development and testing aid.</p><h5 id="file" tabindex="-1">&quot;file&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#file" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;file&quot;&quot;">​</a></h5><p>File logging operates in either a debug or release mode, with the release mode enabled by default. In release mode, the implementation writes the <em>final</em> input into a file. In debug mode, the implementation writes all provided inputs into a file. In both modes, filepath variable values are obtained from the <em>original</em> input.</p><p>A small number of well-known values included in an update request may be referenced in the <em>filepath</em> property definition. Output files need to be differentiated by the ESP service instance that created the transaction instead of the ESP service instance processing the log update. The use of dynamic substitutions instead of hard coded configuration values improves the reusability of configurations. Refer to the <strong>Configuration Reference</strong> for details of which values are available.</p><p>It is possible, if not likely, that one instance of this module will be expected to manage content in multiple files. The use of variable substitutions in the filepath makes it conceivable that every transaction could be written to a new file. To avoid unconstrained use of system resources, a limit on the number of files a module instance has open at one time is imposed through the configuration. It should only be necessary to change the default value when more than one file is expected. For example, multiple files would be expected if the <em>filepath</em> property includes a reference to the ESDL method name.</p><p>To prevent output files from growing to a difficult to manage size, file rollover criteria can be given. Rollover on date change, a pattern seen elsewhere in the platform, is enabled by default. This may be insufficient for heavily used services, which is why rollover by file size may be enabled.</p><h2 id="usage" tabindex="-1">Usage <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usage&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The modular log agent supports two configuration scenarios.</p><p>In the <em><strong>inline configuration</strong></em> scenario, an instance of <strong>LogAgent</strong> contains all available information for the agent. <em>Modular</em> and <em>agent integration</em> properties coexist in the same instance. Everything is in one place; the configuration is <em><strong>inline</strong></em>.</p><p>In the <em><strong>split configuration</strong></em> scenario, an instance of <strong>LogAgent</strong> contains the <em>agent integration</em> properties plus a reference to a separate file specifying <em>modular</em> properties. One configuration is derived from multiple sources; the configuration is <em><strong>split</strong></em>.</p><p>Logging configurations are presented to an ESP from multiple sources. Each configuration scenario is optimized for one or more of these sources, but may be applied to each source.</p><h3 id="legacy" tabindex="-1">Legacy <a class="header-anchor" href="#legacy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Legacy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The ESP process may read an <em>esp.xml</em> configuration file to configure itself and its services. Traditionally this file is auto-generated from an <em>environment.xml</em> file created using <em>configmgr</em>. The ability for <em>configmgr</em> to configure constructs of which it is unaware is limited. Configurations specified with <em>configmgr</em> generally use a split configuration, but an inline configuration may be used to request default agent behavior.</p><p><em>Configmgr</em> includes a component named <em>modularlogagent</em>. This component is used to configure agents from any plugin using the modular agent framework. The modules, and associated <em>modular</em> properties, included in each plugin are unknowns. Reuse by multiple plugins requires that little to no <em>modular</em> property knowledge exists in the component. The component supports the specification of <em>agent integration</em> properties, a split configuration property file, and (to support the default inline configuration option) a trace logging limit.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>configuration</td><td>Optional file path to either an XML or YAML file containing one <strong>LogAgent</strong> element. An empty value implies the use of the default inline configuration. A non-empty value implies the use of a split configuration with all <em>modular</em> properties defined in the external file.</td></tr><tr><td>plugin</td><td>Required shared library identifier. Defaulting to <em>modularlogagent</em>, this value may be changed to refer to another library (e.g., <em>scappsmodularlogagent</em> for this plugin).</td></tr><tr><td>trace-priority-level</td><td>Maximum trace log output message severity to be included in trace log output. The value is ignored unless <em>configuration</em> is empty, in which case the limit applies to the agent and all default modules.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is possible to start an ESP process with a manually edited <em>esp.xml</em> configuration file, and doing so can be useful for debugging. A split configuration could be replaced with an inline equivalent, but this should not be necessary and is discouraged.</p><h3 id="esp-as-an-application" tabindex="-1">ESP as an Application <a class="header-anchor" href="#esp-as-an-application" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ESP as an Application&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The ESP process, rather than reading a traditional <em>esp.xml</em> file, may read an assortment of YAML property files and assemble a configuration equivalent to <em>esp.xml</em>. Because this assembly process will understand the relationship of any log agent to a manager, and a manager to an ESP, the assembled configuration could be an inline configuration.</p><p>This static binding configuration is meant to be limited to user values for essential process setup parameters. Logging configurations are not essential. An end user may consider logging essential to their deployment of an ESP, but the ESP itself is capable of operating without it. Inline configurations are supported for backward compatibility, but split configurations (or an as yet undefined third configuration scenario) may be preferred.</p><h3 id="dynamic-esdl-binding" tabindex="-1">Dynamic ESDL Binding <a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamic-esdl-binding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dynamic ESDL Binding&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In addition to a logging manager configured by either <strong>Legacy</strong> or <strong>ESP as an Application</strong>, the dynamic ESDL service can use managers configured in the dynamic service bindings loaded at runtime. These configurations should be inline, as split configurations may introduce unwanted cross-dependencies between services.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the binding XML must be manually edited. Support for automated assembly of bindings from smaller, reusable property files may be provided in the future.</p><h2 id="sample-configurations" tabindex="-1">Sample Configurations <a class="header-anchor" href="#sample-configurations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sample Configurations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>These examples show only mandatory <em>agent integration</em> and key <em>modular</em> properties.

ESDL services which configure agent instances that do not apply to every transaction may reference these identifiers in custom transforms to manage which agents are applied to a transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Variant/@type</td><td>A</td><td>Identifier of a single kind of log content generated by the agent. An agent that will not be controlled by content kind may omit this identifier. An agent that will be controlled by content kind should specify a unique identifier for each kind of content to be controlled.
