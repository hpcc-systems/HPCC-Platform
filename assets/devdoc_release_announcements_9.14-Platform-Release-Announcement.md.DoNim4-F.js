Version 9.14.0 delivers powerful new capabilities that reduce cloud expenses, accelerate performance, and enhance the user experience across the board.</p><p>The <a href="https://hpccsystems.com/download/release-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release Notes</a> page contains a complete list of changes in this release, but here are a few noteworthy features:</p><h2 id="workunit-summary-page-in-ecl-watch" tabindex="-1">Workunit Summary Page in ECL Watch <a class="header-anchor" href="#workunit-summary-page-in-ecl-watch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Workunit Summary Page in ECL Watch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>ECL Watch now displays a Workunit Summary <em>(ECL Watch → Operations / Topology → WU Summary)</em> that aggregates all the WUs within a given date range into unique error/warning groups. This is intended to help operations spot new error patterns on a release-by-release basis before issues arise.</p><h2 id="a-new-ecl-function-regexextract" tabindex="-1">A new ECL function - REGEXEXTRACT <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-new-ecl-function-regexextract" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A new ECL function - REGEXEXTRACT&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This built-in function allows you to extract text from a STRING, a UTF-8 string, or a UNICODE string based upon a regular expression you provide. Essentially, it filters the text, returning the portions that match the provided pattern and the deleted portions separately.</p><h2 id="platform-api-enhancement" tabindex="-1">Platform API Enhancement <a class="header-anchor" href="#platform-api-enhancement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Platform API Enhancement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The platform now supports configuring block compression when reading via the API. Compressed files now observe the <code>blockedFileIOKB</code> option on the storage plane. If you are using the Azure API to access a storage plane, this can reduce the cost of file I/O. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/blob/master/helm/hpcc/docs/expert.md#blockedFileIOKB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blockedFileIOKB</a>.</p><h2 id="managed-observability-helm-chart" tabindex="-1">Managed Observability Helm Chart <a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-observability-helm-chart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Managed Observability Helm Chart&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a self-contained Observability solution for the HPCC Platform. It leverages the Elastic Stack <em>(Elasticsearch, Kibana, APM Server)</em> and OpenTelemetry Collector to provide tracing Observability data for HPCC clusters. This project delivers a streamlined, secure, and automated way to deploy, configure, and access an Observability infrastructure for testing and development using Helm charts.</p><h2 id="rowservice-random-sampling-support" tabindex="-1">Rowservice Random Sampling Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#rowservice-random-sampling-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rowservice Random Sampling Support&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This allows users of the rowservice to randomly sample datasets instead of reading the entire set. For example, if a data scientist is working on a model that uses a large dataset, they don&#39;t need the entire file when working; they just need a representative slice of the dataset. With the new sampling feature, they can work faster by reading only a small portion of the dataset as they develop a new model.</p><p>It samples randomly across the entire file. So, for example, you could request the dataset be sampled with a sampling rate of <code>0.01</code>, which would result in 1% of the file being returned.</p><p>The specific records in that file are randomly sampled so it won&#39;t inadvertently overrepresent some pattern within the file. Essentially, with a sample rate of <code>0.01</code>, every 100 records the algorithm would choose a random record from that 100.</p><p>There is also support for setting the <code>recordSamplingSeed</code> used by the random generator, so you can get a reproducible sampling.</p>',16)]))}const u=a(n,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
