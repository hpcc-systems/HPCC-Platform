The framework includes a platform component, the engine, that exposes obfuscation logic supplied by dynamically loaded plugin libraries. The framework can be used to obfuscate sensitive data, such as passwords and PII. Possible use cases including preventing trace output from revealing sensitive values and partially masking values in situations where a user needs to see &quot;enough&quot; of a value to confirm its correctness without seeing all of the value (e.g., when a user is asked to confirm the last four digits of an account number).</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>File</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>datamasking.h</td><td>Declares the core framework interfaces.

With different data, requirements for obfuscation may reasonably be expected to vary. Assuming that requirements do change between countries, each country&#39;s requirements could logically constitute a separate domain. The capacity to define multiple <em>domains</em> does not create a requirement to do so.</p><p>Requirements can change over time. To support this, a <em>domain</em> can be seen as a collection of requirement snapshots where each snapshot defines the complete set of requirements for the <em>domain</em> at a point in time. Snapshots are referenced by unique version numbers, which should be sequential starting at <em>1</em>.</p><p>Obfuscation is always applied based on a single snapshot of a domain&#39;s requirements.</p><p><em>Domains</em> are represented in the framework interface as text identifiers. Each distinct <em>domain</em> is identified by at least one unique identifier.</p><h3 id="masker" tabindex="-1">Masker <a class="header-anchor" href="#masker" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Masker&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A <em>masker</em> is a provider of obfuscation for a single snapshot of a <em>domain&#39;s</em> requirements. There are three masking operations defined in this framework. Each instance decides which of the three it will support, and how it will support them. The three operations are:</p><ul><li><code>maskValue</code> obfuscates individual values based on snapshot-defined meanings. For example, a value identified as a password might require complete obfuscation anywhere it appears, or an account number may require complete obfuscation in some cases and partial obfuscation in others.</li><li><code>maskContent</code> obfuscates a variable number of values based on context provided by surrounding text. For example, the value of an HTTP <em>authentication</em> header or the text between <code>&lt;Password&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/Password&gt;</code> might require obfuscation. This operation can apply to both structured and unstructured text content.</li><li><code>maskMarkupValue</code> obfuscates individual values based on their locationa within an in-memory representation of a structured document, such as XML or JSON. For example, the value of element <code>Password</code> might require obfuscation unconditionally, while the value of element <code>Value</code> might require obfuscation only if a sibling element named <code>Name</code> exists with value <em>password</em>. This operation relies on the caller&#39;s ability to supply context parsed from structured content.</li></ul><p>A masker may be either stateless or stateful. With a stateless masker, identical input will produce identical output for every requested operation. A stateful masker, however, enables its user to affect operation outputs (i.e., identical input may not produce identical output for each operation).</p><p><em>Maskers</em> are represented in the framework interface using <code>IDataMasker</code>, with <code>IDataMaskerInspector</code> providing access to less frequently used information about the <em>domain</em>.</p><h3 id="profile" tabindex="-1">Profile <a class="header-anchor" href="#profile" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Profile&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A <em>profile</em> is a stateless <em>masker</em>. Each instance defines the requirements of one or more snapshots of a single <em>domain</em>.</p><p>Snapshots are versioned. Each <em>profile</em> declares a minimum, maximum, and default version. <em>Masker</em> operations apply to the default version. Other declared versions may be accessed using a stateful <em>context</em>, which the <em>profile</em> can create on demand.</p><p>Each instance must support at least one version of a <em>domain&#39;s</em> requirements. Whether an instance supports more than one version depends on the implementation and on user preference. A <em>domain</em> can be viewed as a collection of one or more <em>profiles</em> where each <em>profile</em> defines a unique set of requirement snapshots applicable to the same underlying data.</p><p>Refer to <code>IDataMaskingProfile</code> (extending <code>IDataMasker</code>) and <code>IDataMaskingProfileInspector</code> (extending <code>IDataMaskerInspector</code>) for additional information.</p><h3 id="context" tabindex="-1">Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Context&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A <em>context</em> is a stateful <em>masker</em>. Instantiated by and tightly coupled to a <em>profile</em>, it provides some user control over how masking operations are completed.</p><ul><li>For a <em>profile</em> supporting multiple versions, the requirements of a non-default version may be applied.</li><li>Custom properties, defined by a <em>profile</em>, may be managed. <ul><li><code>valuetype-set</code> is a pre-defined property used to select the group of <em>value types</em> that may be masked by any operation.</li><li><code>rule-set</code> is a pre-defined property used to select the group of <em>rules</em> that will be applied for <code>maskContent</code> requests.</li><li><em>Profile</em> implementations may define additional properties as needed. For example, one might define <code>mask-pattern</code> to override the default obfuscation pattern to avoid replicating (and complicating) configurations just to change the appearance of obfuscated data.</li></ul></li><li>Trace output produced by operation requests, including errors and warnings encountered during request processing, can be controlled per context. This does not affect the operation output, per-se, but provides compatibility with transactional trace output control.</li></ul><p>Refer to <code>IDataMaskingProfileContext</code> (extending <code>IDataMasker</code>) and <code>IDataMaskingProfileContextInspector</code> (extending <code>IDataMaskerInspector</code>) for additional information.</p><h3 id="value-type" tabindex="-1">Value Type <a class="header-anchor" href="#value-type" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Value Type&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Each snapshot defines one or more <em>value types</em>. A <em>value type</em> is a representation of the requirements pertaining to a particular concept of a <em>domain</em> datum. Requirements include:</p><ul><li>instructions for identifying occurrences based on contextual clues found in a body of text; and</li><li>instructions for applying obfuscation to an identified value.</li></ul><p>A Social Security Number, or SSN, is a U.S.-centric datum that requires obfuscation and for which a <em>value type</em> may be defined. Element names associated with an SSN may include, but are not limited to, <em>SSN</em> and <em>SOCS</em>; the <em>value type</em> is expected to identify all such names used within the <em>domain</em>. SSN occurrences are frequently partially masked, with common formats being to mask only the first four or the last five digits of the nine digit number; the <em>value type</em> defines which formats are available besides the default of masking all characters.</p><p><em>Value types</em> are represented in the framework using <code>IDataMaskingProfileValueType</code>. They are accessed through the <code>IDataMaskerInspector</code> interface.</p><h3 id="mask-style" tabindex="-1">Mask Style <a class="header-anchor" href="#mask-style" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mask Style&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A <em>mask style</em> describes how obfuscation is applied to a value. It is always defined in the context of a <em>value type</em>, and a <em>value type</em> may define multiple.</p><p>A <em>value type</em> is not required to define any <em>mask styles</em>. If none are defined, all value characters are obfuscated. If the requested <em>mask style</em> is not defined, the default obfuscation occurs; the <em>value type</em> will not attempt to guess which of the defined styles is appropriate.</p><p><em>Mask styles</em> are represented in the framework using <code>IDataMaskingProfileMaskStyle</code>. They are accessed through the <code>IDataMaskingProfileValueType</code> interface.</p><h3 id="rule" tabindex="-1">Rule <a class="header-anchor" href="#rule" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rule&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A <em>rule</em> contains the information necessary to locate at least one occurrence of a <em>value type</em> datum to be obfuscated. It is always defined in the context of a <em>value type</em>, and a <em>value type</em> may define multiple.</p><p><em>maskValue</em> requests do not use <em>rules</em>. <em>maskContent</em> requests rely on <em>rules</em> for locating affected values, with the relationship between a <em>profile</em> and its <em>rules</em> an implementation detail. <em>maskMarkupValue</em> requests, when implemented, may also use <em>rules</em> or may take an entirely different approach.</p><p><em>Rules</em> are represented in the framework as an abastract concept that cannot be inspected individually. Inspection may be used to establish the presence of <em>rules</em>, but not to examine individual instances.</p><h3 id="plugin" tabindex="-1">Plugin <a class="header-anchor" href="#plugin" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Plugin&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The combination of a shared library and entry point function describes a <em>plugin</em>. The input to a <em>plugin</em> is a property tree describing one or more <em>profiles</em>. The output of an entry point function is an iterator of <em>profiles</em>. The <em>profiles</em> created by the function may all be associated with the same <em>domain</em>, but this is not required.</p><p><em>Plugin</em> results are represented in the framework using <code>IDataMaskingProfileIterator</code>.</p><h3 id="engine" tabindex="-1">Engine <a class="header-anchor" href="#engine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Engine&quot;">​</a></h3><p>An <em>engine</em> is the platform&#39;s interface to obfuscation. It loads <em>domains</em> by loading one or more <em>plugins</em>. <em>Plugins</em> yield <em>profiles</em>, from which <em>domains</em> are inferred.</p><p>Once configured with at least one <em>domain</em>, a caller can obtain obfuscation in multiple ways:</p><ol><li>As an instance of a stateless <em>masker</em>, an <em>engine</em> can provide obfuscation. The default version of the default <em>profile</em> of the default <em>domain</em> will be used, and no custom <em>context</em> properties can be used. This is the simplest integration, appropriate for use when the host process implicitly trusts that the default configuration is sufficient.</li><li>An <em>engine</em> may be used to obtain a stateless <em>profile</em> for a specific <em>domain</em>. If no version is requested, the default <em>profile</em> of the requested <em>domain</em> will be used. If a version is specified, the <em>domain</em> <em>profile</em> supporting the requested version is used. This usage supports host processes that are aware of <em>domains</em> and need to use specific instances.</li><li>An <em>engine</em> may be used to obtain a <em>context</em> tied to a specific version of a <em>domain</em>. The default <em>domain</em> may be requested with an empty string. The default version may be requested by passing <em>0</em>. With a <em>context</em>, a caller may manipulate further the environment for obfuscation requests.</li></ol><p><em>Engines</em> are represented in the framework using <code>IDataMaskingEngine</code> (extending <code>IDataMasker</code>) and <code>IDataMaskingEngineInspector</code> for additional information.</p><h2 id="environment" tabindex="-1">Environment <a class="header-anchor" href="#environment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Environment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This section assumes a <em>context</em> is in use. Absent a <em>context</em>, only the default state of the default version of a <em>profile</em> can be used.</p><p>The framework reserves multiple custom property names, which are described in subsequent subsections. It also allows implementations to define additional properties using any non-reserved name.</p><p>Suppose an implementation defines a property to override the default obfuscation pattern. Let&#39;s call this property <code>default-pattern</code>. A caller could interrogate a <em>masker</em> to know if <code>default-pattern</code> is accepted. If accepted, <code>setProperty(&quot;default-patterns&quot;, &quot;#&quot;)</code> can be used to register an override.</p><p>All custom properties, whether defined in the framework or in third party libraries, are managed using a generic <em>context</em> interface.

The custom <em>context</em> property <strong>valuetype-set</strong> is used to select a different set.</p><p>The rationale for this is an expectation that certain data always requires obfuscation. A password, for example, would never not require obfuscation. Other data may only require obfuscacation in certain situations, such as when required by individual customer agreements.
