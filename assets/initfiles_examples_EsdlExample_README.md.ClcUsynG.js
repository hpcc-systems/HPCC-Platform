Check the README.md file in each directory for example details and directions. Currently these examples are tailored for a bare-metal deployments, with container or cloud focused examples forthcoming. A brief description of each example is below:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BasicRoxie</td><td>A service running on Roxie customized with some simple ESDL Scripts.</td></tr><tr><td>CppPlugin</td><td>A service running as a C++ plugin.</td></tr><tr><td>JavaPlugin</td><td>A service running as a Java plugin.</td></tr><tr><td>Manifest</td><td>A service running on Roxie customized with complex ESDL Scripts. The service configuration is built from a manifest file and separately maintained files in the EsdlScripts folder. This is to show how you can use configuration as code by managing complex service scripts in a code respository along with a manifest file to derive the final service configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>MySqlService</td><td>A work in progress that will show how you can use a combination of ESDL Scripts and a backing MySql database to implment a service.</td></tr></tbody></table>`,4)]))}const u=s(t,[["render",p]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
