If set, it will limit the maximum number of parallel connections and partition streams that will be active at any one time. By default a DFU job will run as many active connection/streams as there are partitions involved in the spray, limited to an absolute maximum of 800. Setting maxConnections can be set to reduce this concurrency. This might be helpful in some scenarios where the concurrency is causing network congestion and degraded performance.</p><h2 id="keepalive-time-unsigned-interval-unsigned-probes-unsigned" tabindex="-1">keepalive (time: unsigned, interval: unsigned, probes: unsigned) <a class="header-anchor" href="#keepalive-time-unsigned-interval-unsigned-probes-unsigned" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;keepalive (time: unsigned, interval: unsigned, probes: unsigned)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See keepalive example above. If set, these settings will override the system default socket keepalive settings each time the platform creates a socket. This may be useful in some scenarios if the connections would otherwise be closed prematurely by external factors (e.g. firewalls). An example of this is that Azure instances will close sockets that have been idle for greater than 4 minutes that are connected outside of its networks.</p><h2 id="savequerydlls-boolean" tabindex="-1">saveQueryDlls (boolean) <a class="header-anchor" href="#savequerydlls-boolean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;saveQueryDlls (boolean)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a Thor only setting.
