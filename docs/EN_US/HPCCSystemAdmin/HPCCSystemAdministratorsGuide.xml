      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>HPCC (High Performance Computing Cluster) Systems is a massive
      parallel-processing computing platform that solves Big Data
      problems.</para>

      <para>HPCC Systems platform stores and processes large quantities of
      data, processing billions of records per second using massive parallel
      processing technology. Large amounts of data across disparate data
      sources can be accessed, analyzed, and manipulated in fractions of
      seconds. HPCC Systems functions as both a processing and a distributed
      data storage environment, capable of analyzing terabytes of
      information.</para>

      <title>Architectural Overview</title>

      <para>An HPCC Systems<superscript>®</superscript> Platform consists of
      the following components: Thor, Roxie, ESP Server, Dali, Sasha, DFU
      Server, and ECLCC Server. LDAP security is optionally available.</para>

      <para>Data loading is controlled through the Distributed File Utility
      (DFU) server.</para>

      <para>Data typically arrives on the landing zone (for example, by FTP).
      File movement (across components) is initiated by DFU. Data is copied
      from the landing zone and is distributed (sprayed) to the Data Refinery
      (Thor) by the ECL code. Data can be further processed via ETL (Extract,
      Transform, and Load process) in the refinery.</para>

      <para>A single physical file is distributed into multiple physical files
      across the nodes of a cluster. The aggregate of the physical files
      creates one logical file that is addressed by the ECL code.</para>

        <title>Clusters</title>

        <para>HPCC Systems environment contains clusters which you define and
        use according to your needs. The types of clusters used by HPCC
        Systems:</para>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_Thor_Cluster">
          <title>Thor</title>

          <para>Data Refinery (Thor) -- Used to process every one of billions
          of records in order to create billions of "improved" records. ECL
          Agent (hThor) is also used to process simple jobs that would be an
          inefficient use of the Thor cluster.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_Roxie_Cluster">
          <title>Roxie</title>

          <para>Rapid Data Delivery Engine (Roxie) -- Used to search quickly
          for a particular record or set of records.</para>

          <para>Queries are compiled and published, usually in ECL Watch. Data
          moves in parallel from Thor nodes to the receiving Roxie nodes.
          Parallel bandwidth utilization improves the speed of putting new
          data into play.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_Clusters_ECLAgent">
          <title>ECL Agent</title>

          <para>The ECL Agent's primary function is to send the job to execute
          on the appropriate cluster. The ECL Agent can act as a single-node
          cluster. That is called spawning an hThor cluster. hThor is used to
          process simple jobs that would otherwise be an inefficient use of
          Thor. For simple tasks, the ECL Agent will make a determination and
          perform the execution itself by acting as an hThor cluster. <figure>

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="SysAdm_SystemServers" role="brk">
        <title>System Servers</title>

        <para>The System Servers are integral middleware components of an HPCC
        Systems platform. They are used to control workflow and
        inter-component communication.</para>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_Dali">
          <title>Dali</title>

          <para>Dali is also known as the system data store. It manages
          workunit records, logical file directory, and shared object
          services. It maintains the message queues that drive job execution
          and scheduling.</para>

          <para>Dali also performs session management. It tracks all active
          Dali client sessions registered in the environment, such that you
          can list all clients and their roles. (see <emphasis>dalidiag
          -clients</emphasis>)</para>

          <para>Another task Dali performs is to act as the locking manager.
          HPCC Systems uses Dali's locking manager to control shared and
          exclusive locks to metadata.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_Sahsa">
          <title>Sasha</title>

          <para>The Sasha server is a companion "housekeeping" server to the
          Dali server. Sasha works independently of, yet in conjunction with
          Dali. Sasha's main function is to reduce the stress on the Dali
          server. Wherever possible, Sasha reduces the resource utilization on
          Dali. A very important aspect of Sasha is coalescing, by saving the
          in-memory store to a new store edition.</para>

          <para>Sasha archives workunits (including DFU Workunits) that are
          then stored in folders on a disk.</para>

          <para>Sasha also performs routine housekeeping such as removing
          cached workunits and DFU recovery files.</para>

          <para>Sasha can also run XREF, to cross reference physical files
          with logical metadata, to determine if there are lost/found/orphaned
          files. It then presents options (via EclWatch) for their recovery or
          deletion.</para>

          <para>Sasha is the component responsible for removing expired files
          when the criteria has been met. The EXPIRE option on ECL's OUTPUT or
          PERSIST sets that condition.</para>

    <title>Hardware and Components</title>

    <para>This section provides some insight as to what sort of hardware and
    infrastructure optimally HPCC Systems works well on. This is not an
    exclusive comprehensive set of instructions, nor a mandate on what
    hardware you must have. Consider this as a guide to use when looking to
    implement or scale your HPCC Systems platform. These suggestions should be
    taken into consideration for your specific enterprise needs.</para>

    <para>HPCC Systems is designed to run on commodity hardware, which makes
    building and maintaining large scale (petabytes) clusters economically
    feasible. When planning your cluster hardware, you will need to balance a
    number of considerations, including fail-over domains and potential
    performance issues. Hardware planning should include distributing HPCC
    Systems across multiple physical hosts, such as a cluster. Generally, one
    type of best practice is to run HPCC Systems processes of a particular
    type, for example Thor, Roxie, or Dali, on a host configured specifically
    for that type of process.</para>

    <sect1 id="SysAdm_ThorHW">
      <title>Thor Hardware</title>

      <para>Thor slave nodes require a proper balance of CPU, RAM, network,
      and disk I/O in order to operate most efficiently. A single Thor slave
      node works optimally when allocated 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, 1Gb/sec
      network and 200MB/sec sequential read/write disk I/O.</para>

      <para>Hardware architecture can provide higher value within a single
      physical server. In such cases you can use multi-slave to configure your
      larger physical servers to run multiple Thor slave nodes per physical
      server.</para>

      <para>It is important to note that HPCC Systems by nature is a parallel
      processing system and all Thor slave nodes will be exercising at
      precisely the same time. So when allocating more than one HPCC Systems
      Thor slave per physical machine assure that each slave meets the
      recommended requirements.</para>

      <para>For instance, 1 physical server with 48 cores, 96GB RAM, 10Gb/sec
      network and 2GB/sec sequential I/O would be capable of running ten (10)
      HPCC Systems Thor slaves at optimal efficiency. The order of
      optimization for resource usage in a Thor slave node is disk I/O 60%,
      network 30%, and CPU 10%. Any increase in sequential I/O will have the
      most impact on speed, followed by improvements in network, followed by
      improvements in CPU.</para>

      <para>Network architecture is also an important consideration. HPCC
      Systems Thor nodes work optimally in a streamlined network architecture
      between all Thor slave processes.</para>

      <para>RAID is recommended and all RAID levels suitable for sequential
      read/write operations and high availability are acceptable. For example,
      RAID1, RAID10, RAID5 (preferred), and RAID6.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="SysAdm_RoxieHW">
      <title>Roxie Hardware Configurations</title>

      <para>HPCC Systems Roxie processes require require a proper, yet
      different (from Thor) balance of CPU, RAM, network, and disk I/O in
      order to ensure efficient operations. A single HPCC Systems Roxie node
      works optimally when allocated 6 or more CPU cores, 24GB RAM, 1Gb/sec
      network backbone, and 400/sec 4k random read IOPS.</para>

      <para>Each HPCC Systems Roxie node is presented two hard drives, each
      capable of 200/sec 4k random seek IOPS. Hard drive recommendations for
      Roxie efficiency are 15K SAS, or SSD. A good rule of thumb is the more
      random read IOPS the better and faster your Roxie will perform.</para>

      <para>Running multiple HPCC Systems Roxie nodes on a single physical
      server is not recommended, except in the cases of virtualization or
      containers.</para>

      <para>Configure your system to balance the size of your Thor and Roxie
      clusters. The number of Roxie nodes should never exceed the number of
      Thor nodes. In addition, the number of Thor nodes should be evenly
      divisible by the number of Roxie nodes. This ensures an efficient
      distribution of file parts from Thor to Roxie.</para>

    <sect1 id="SysAdm_Dali_Sasha">
      <title>Dali and Sasha Hardware Configurations</title>

      <para>HPCC Systems Dali processes store cluster metadata in RAM. For
      optimal efficiency, provide at least 48GB of RAM, 6 or more CPU cores,
      1Gb/sec network interface and a high availability disk for a single HPCC
      Systems Dali. The HPCC Systems Dali processes are one of the few native
      active/passive components. Using standard "swinging disk" clustering is
      recommended for a high availability setup. For a single HPCC Systems
      Dali process, any suitable High Availability (HA) RAID level is
      fine.</para>

      <para>Sasha only stores data to locally available disks, reading data
      from Dali then processing it by archiving workunits (WUs) to disk. It is
      beneficial to configure Sasha for a larger amount of archiving so that
      Dali does not keep too many workunits in memory. This requires a larger
      amount of disk space.</para>

      <para>Allocating greater disk space for Sasha is sound practice as
      configuring Sasha for more archiving better benefits Dali. Since Sasha
      assists Dali by performing housekeeping, it works best when on its own
      node. Ideally, you should avoid putting Sasha and Dali on the same node,
      because the node that runs these components is extremely critical,
      particularly when it comes to recovering from losses. Therefore, it
      should be as robust as possible: RAID drives, fault tolerant,
      etc.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Sasha/Dali Interactions</title>

        <para>A critical role of Sasha is in coalescing. When Dali shuts down,
        it saves its in-memory store to a new store edition by creating a new
        <emphasis>dalisdsXXXX.xml</emphasis>, where XXXX is incremented to the
        new edition. The current edition is recorded by the filename
        store.XXXX</para>

        <para>An explicit request to save using
        <emphasis>dalidiag</emphasis>:</para>

        <programlisting> dalidiag . -save </programlisting>

        <para>The new editions, as per the above example are created the same
        way. During an explicit save, all changes to SDS are blocked.
        Therefore all clients will block if they try to make any alteration
        until the save is complete.</para>

        <para>There are some options (though not commonly used) that can
        configure Dali to detect quiet/idle time and force a save in exactly
        the same way an explicit save request does, meaning that it will block
        any write transactions while saving.</para>

        <para>All Dali SDS changes are recorded in a delta transaction log (in
        XML format) with a naming convention of
        <emphasis>daliincXXXX.xml</emphasis>, where XXXX is the current store
        edition. They are also optionally mirrored to a backup location. This
        transaction log grows indefinitely until the store is saved.</para>

        <para>In the normal/recommended setup, Sasha is the primary creator of
        new SDS store editions. It does so on a schedule and according to
        other configuration options (for example, you could configure for a
        minimum delta transaction log size). Sasha reads the last saved store
        and the current transaction log and replays the transaction log over
        the last saved store to form a new in-memory version, and then saves
        it. Unlike the Dali saving process, this does not block or interfere
        with Dali. In the event of abrupt termination of the Dali process
        (such as being killed or a power loss) Dali uses the same delta
        transaction log at restart in order to replay the last save and
        changes to return to the last operational state.</para>

    <title>Routine Maintenance</title>

    <para>In order to ensure that your HPCC Systems platform keeps running
    optimally, some care and maintenance is required. The following sections
    address routine maintenance tasks for your HPCC Systems platform.</para>

    <!--***SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK UP***TO COME***-->

    <sect1 id="SysAdmin_DataHandling">
      <title>Data Handling</title>

      <para>When you start working with your HPCC Systems platform, you will
      want to have some data on the system to process. Data gets transferred
      to the HPCC Systems platform by a process called a spray. Likewise to
      get data out from an HPCC Systems platform it must be desprayed.</para>

      <para>As the HPCC Systems platform is a computer cluster the data gets
      deployed out over the nodes that make up the cluster. A
      <emphasis>spray</emphasis> or import is the relocation of a data file
      from one location (such as a Landing Zone) to a cluster. The term spray
      was adopted due to the nature of the file movement -- the file is
      partitioned across all nodes within a cluster.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>despray</emphasis> or export is the relocation of a
      data file from a Data Refinery cluster to a single machine location
      (such as a Landing Zone). The term despray was adopted due to the nature
      of the file movement -- the file is reassembled from its parts on all
      nodes in the cluster and placed in a single file on the
      destination.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>Landing Zone</emphasis> (or drop zone) is a physical
      storage location defined in your system's environment. There can be one
      or more of these locations defined. A daemon (dafilesrv) must be running
      on that server to enable file sprays and desprays. You can spray or
      despray some files to your landing zone through ECL Watch. To upload
      large files, you will need a tool that supports the secure copy
      protocol, something like a WinSCP.</para>

      <title>Back Up Data</title>

      <para>An integral part of routine maintenance is the backup of essential

      This section is not meant to replace your current backup strategy,
      instead this section supplements it by outlining special considerations
      for HPCC Systems<superscript>®</superscript>.</para>

      <sect2 id="SysAdm_BackUpConsider">
        <title>Backup Considerations</title>

        <para>You probably already have some sort of a backup strategy in
        place, by adding HPCC Systems<superscript>®</superscript> into your
        operating environment there are some additional considerations to be
        aware of. The following sections discuss backup considerations for the
        individual HPCC Systems components.</para>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_BkU_Dali">
          <title>Dali</title>

          <para>Dali can be configured to create its own backup. It is
          strongly recommended that the backup be kept on a different server
          or node for disaster recovery purposes. You can specify the Dali
          backup folder location using the Configuration Manager. You may want
          to keep multiple generations of backups, to be able to restore to a
          certain point in time. For example, you may want to do daily
          snapshots, or weekly.</para>

          <para>You may want to keep backup copies at a system level using
          traditional methods. Regardless of method or scheme you would be
          well advised to backup your Dali.</para>

          <para>You should try to avoid putting Dali, Sasha, and even your
          Thor Master on the same node. Ideally you want each of these
          components to be on separate nodes to not only reduce the stress on
          the system hardware (allowing the system to operate better) but also
          enabling you to recover your entire environment, files, and
          workunits in the event of a loss. In addition it would affect every
          other Thor/Roxie cluster in the same environment if you lose this
          node.</para>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_BkUp_Sasha">
          <title>Sasha</title>

          <para>Sasha is the component that does the SDS coalescing. It is
          normally the sole component that creates new store editions. It's
          also the component that creates the XREF metadata that ECLWatch
          uses. Be aware that Sasha can create quite a bit of archive data.
          Once the workunits are archived they are no longer available in the
          Dali data store. The archives can still be accessed through ECL
          Watch by restoring them to Dali.</para>

          Backup Thor by configuring replication and setting up a nightly back

          a script. You can also use backupnode regularly in a crontab or by
          adding a backupnode component with Configuration Manager to your
          environment. You would always want to run it on the Thor master of
          that cluster.</para>

          provide descriptive names for your Thor clusters.</para>

          <para>For example, if your Thor cluster is named thor400_7s, you
          would call start_backupnode thor400_7s.</para>

          <para>To run backupnode regularly you could use cron. For example,

    <title>System Configuration and Management</title>

    <para>HPCC Systems require configuration. The Configuration Manager tool
    (configmgr) included with the system software is a valuable piece of
    setting up your HPCC Systems platform. The Configuration Manager is a
    graphical tool provided that can be used to configure your system.
    Configuration Manager has a wizard that you can run which will easily
    generate an environment file to get you configured, up and running
    quickly. There is an advanced option available through Configuration
    Manager which allows for a more specific configuration, while still using
    the graphical interface. If desired you can edit the environment files
    using any xml or text editor however the file structure must remain
    valid.</para>

        <para>The HPCC Systems platform supports

        The priority assigned to a process indicates to the CPU to provide

        highest priority, and a value of 19 is the lowest.</para>

        <para>The default environment.conf file is delivered with the nice

        script. This can be done automatically by enabling the
        hpcc-environemnt-monitor.path systemd script. The
        hpcc-environemnt-monitor.path script calls a corresponding service
        script of the same name whenever environment.xml is modified.</para>

        <para>When you attempt to regenerate the hpccsystems-platform.target,

        the target system. After the generate-hpccsystems-target.sh script is
        done invoking the hpccsystems configgen utility, the appropriate

      <para>The performance of your system can vary depending on how some
      components interact. One area which could impact performance is the
      relationship with users, groups, and Active Directory. If possible,
      having a separate Active Directory specific to HPCC Systems could be a
      good policy. There have been a few instances where just one Active
      Directory servicing many, diverse applications has been less than
      optimal.</para>

      <para>HPCC Systems makes setting up your Active Directory OU's
      relatively easy. ESP creates all the OU's for you when it starts up,
      based on the settings you defined in Configuration Manager. You can then
      start Dali/ESP and use ECLWatch to add or modify users or groups.</para>

      <para>You can assign permissions to each user individually, however it
      is more manageable to assign these permissions to groups, and then add
      users to these groups as appropriate. Create a group for developers and
      power users (people with full read/write/delete access), and another
      group for users that only have only read access and perhaps another
      group that has both read and write access. Add any other groups as

      provides some more information to consider when incorporating HPCC
      Systems into your disaster recovery plan.</para>

      <sect2 id="Thor_HA">
        <title>Thor</title>

        <para>When designing a Thor cluster for high availability, consider
        how it actually works -- a Thor cluster accepts jobs from a job queue.
        If there are two Thor clusters servicing the job queue, one will
        continue accepting jobs if the other one fails.</para>

        <para>With replication enabled, the still-functioning Thor will be
        able to read data from the back up location of the broken Thor. Other
        components (such as ECL Server, or ESP) can also have multiple
        instances. The remaining components, such as Dali, or DFU Server, work
        in a traditional shared storage high availability failover
        model.</para>

        <para>Another important consideration is to keep your ESP and Dali on
        separate nodes from your Thor master. This way if your Thor master
        fails, you can replace it, bring up the replacement with the same IP
        (address) and it should then come up. Since Thor stores no workunit
        data, the DALI and ESP can provide the file metadata to recover your
        workunits.</para>

        <sect3 id="Thor_HA_Downside">
          <title>The Downside</title>

          <para>Costs twice as much initially because you essentially have to
          have two of everything.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_HA_ThorUpside">
          <title>The Upside</title>

          <para>Almost 100% of the time you can utilize the additional
          processing capacity. You can run more jobs, have more space,
          etc.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_HA_ThorDR">
          <title>Disaster Recovery concerns</title>

          <para>The important factor to consider for disaster recovery (DR) is
          the bandwidth required to replicate your data. Your network
          administrator should evaluate this aspect carefully.</para>

          <para>If you have tens of gigabytes of delta each day then an rsync
          type replication or some sort of hybrid model should suffice. If you
          have hundreds of gigabytes to petabytes of deltas, the real limit is
          your budget.</para>

          <para>A best practice is to find where the data is the smallest (at
          ingestion, after normalization, at Roxie) and replicate from that
          point and rerun the processing in both locations.</para>

          <para>The key to getting disaster recovery right is to know your
          data flow. For instance, if you are ingesting 20TB of raw data
          daily, then taking that raw data and rolling it up, scoring it,
          indexing it, etc. You would be better off replicating an
          intermediate dataset (that we call base files), rather than
          replicating the large ingest. If the opposite is occurring (small
          daily ingest and then blow the data up in size) -- you would be
          better off to ingest the input and then re-run it.</para>

          <para>Thor has the ability to do a "Thor copy" which copies data
          from one cluster to another. You can also do this through ECL code.
          Additionally, you may decide you don't want, or need to have a "hot"
          DR Thor. In that case, the most common minor disasters cause only a
          relatively brief, less than 1 day disaster. Since Thor is
          responsible for creating data updates it can take a day or a few to
          recover. The data just is not quite as fresh but as long as the
          Roxies are replicated the data is still flowing. In the case of a
          major disaster such as, a major earthquake, a tidal wave, extended
          total power loss, multiple fiber cuts, where the systems will be out
          for a day or more. The likelihood of that occurring may not justify
          the costs of preventing against it.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_HA_ThorConclusion">
          <title>Conclusion</title>

          <para>Disaster recovery is a calculation. The cost of failure, times
          the likelihood per year of an event occurring, less than or greater
          than the cost to prevent against it. Taking all that into
          consideration can help you to put a sensible DR plan in
          place.</para>
        </sect3>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="HA_Roxie">
        <title>Roxie</title>

        <para>In the case of Roxie, a best practice is to have multiple Roxie
        clusters and use a proxy to balance. In case of how to keep the data
        in sync, a pull approach is best. The Roxie automatically pulls the
        data it needs from the "source" listed in the package file. The data
        can also be pulled from another Roxie or a Thor. In most cases you
        would pull to your DR Roxie from the primary Roxie out of the load
        balancer, but it can also pull from a Thor in the primary location as
        well.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="HA_Middlewear">
        <title>Middleware</title>

        <para>Replication of some components (ECL Agent, ESP/Eclwatch, DFU
        Server, etc.) are pretty straight forward as they really don't have
        anything to replicate. Dali is the biggest consideration when it comes
        to replication. In the case of Dali, you have Sasha as the backup
        locally. The Dali files can be replicated using rsync. A better
        approach could be to use a synchronizing device (cluster WAN sync, SAN
        block replication, etc.), and just put the Dali stores on that and
        just allow it replicate as designed.</para>

        <para>There isn't just a one size fits all approach. Special care,
        design, and planning are required to make an effective DR strategy
        that doesn't "over synchronize" across slow WAN links, but still
        provides you with an acceptable level of redundancy for your business
        needs.</para>

      <title>Best Practice Considerations</title>

      <para>There are several other aspects to best practice considerations,
      and these will change with your system requirements. The following
      sections are some best practice considerations for some aspects of the
      HPCC Systems platform. Keep in mind that suggested best practices are
      merely suggested and may not be appropriate for your needs. A thorough
      review of the considerations highlighted here can be very helpful if
      your needs align with the stated considerations.</para>

      <sect2 id="SysAdm_BestPrac_MultiThor">
        <title>Multiple Thors</title>

        <para>You can run multiple Thors on the same physical hardware.
        Multiple Thors on the same hardware are independent and unaware of
        each other. The Thors run jobs as they receive them, regardless of
        what the other(s) is/are doing. The speed of a single job will never
        be faster with multiple Thors, but the throughput can be. You can run
        two Thors picking up jobs from two different queues or the same
        queue.</para>

        <para>The downside of running multiple Thors on the same hardware is
        that the physical memory on the nodes needs to be shared among each of
        the Thors. This needs to be configured per Thor cluster
        definition.</para>

        <para>Multiple Thors on the same cluster require them to share the
        same build and installation. The environment defines each Thor
        cluster, which can share the same machine set. There are slave and
        master port settings that need to be set to avoid clashing. There are
        also memory sharing/splitting considerations and settings that need to
        be made. The table below indicates settings in the environment to
        consider.</para>

        <para>You must not place multiple Thors on hardware which does not
        have enough CPU cores to support it. You should not have more Thors

          <title>Multiple Nodes</title>

          <para>Try to keep resources running on their own nodes, if possible
          for either one or multiple Thor clusters. If running some kind of
          active/passive high availability, don't keep your active and passive
          master on the same node. Try to keep Dali and ESP on separate nodes.
          Even if you don't have the luxury of very many nodes, you want the
          Thor master and the Dali (at minimum) to be on separate nodes. The
          best practice is to keep as many components as possible on their own
          nodes.</para>

          <para>Another consideration for a multiple node system is to avoid
          putting any of the components on nodes with slaves. This is not a
          best practice and leads to an unbalanced cluster, resulting in those
          slaves with less memory/cpu taking longer than the rest and dragging
          the whole performance of the cluster down as a result.</para>

          <para>There is a case where a system policy or practice could cause
          an issue with Thor nodes. At startup if a Thor cluster hangs, and
          then eventually times out. Then if your Thormaster log shows that
          the master is fine, but indicates that it is waiting to connect the
          slaves. Then you may have an issue with the SSH daemon
          configuration.</para>

          <para>There is a security feature called

          (the OpenSSH server process) that will disallow connections from
          anyone not declared on that list. This is not default for sshd,
          rather it is an option that must be enabled. If that option is
          enabled that can cause the Thor nodes to hang in the manner
          described. If that option is enabled, then you must unset the
          option, or add the hpcc user to the AllowUsers list.</para>

          the global RHS into memory, it will HASH PARTITION the RHS and HASH
          DISTRIBUTE the LHS and perform a LOCAL LOOKUP JOIN.</para>

          <para>If it cannot fit the local RHS set into memory on any given
          node, then it will gather and sort both local datasets and perform a
          standard JOIN.</para>

          <para>The key advantage of LOOKUP JOIN is speed. If the RHS fits
          into memory, it can perform a very quick gather and streamed JOIN of
          a large LHS set, without the need of gathering and sorting
          anything.</para>

          <para>The advantages of a virtual slave Thor configuration for ECL
          code using LOOKUP/SMART JOIN is that in effect it will have N times
          as much memory before it fails or fails over in the SMART JOIN
          case.</para>

          <para>It is also much quicker; instead of broadcasting the local RHS
          to N slave process per node; it only has to communicate it to one.
          That one slave can share the same table and same HT with the other
          virtual slaves directly.</para>

        <title>Huge Pages</title>

        <para>Linux uses pages as its basic units of memory. Your system may
        run faster and benefit from huge page support. Huge pages of the
        appropriate type and size need to be allocated from the operating
        system. Almost all current Linux systems are set up with Transparent
        Huge Pages (THP) available by default.</para>

        <para>Thor, Roxie, and ECL Agent clusters all have options in the
        configuration to enable huge page support. The Transparent Huge Pages
        are enabled for Thor, Roxie, and ECL Agent clusters in the default
        HPCC Systems environment. Thor clusters can stand to benefit more from
        huge pages than can Roxie.</para>

        <para>You can check the file
        /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled to see what your OS
        setting is. With THP you do not have to explicitly set a size. If your
        system is not configured to use THP, then you may want to implement
        Huge Pages.</para>

        <sect3 id="SysAdm_BestPrac_SetUpHuge_Pgs">
          <title>Setting up Huge Pages</title>

          <para>To set up huge page support, consult your OS documentation and
          determine how to enable huge page support. For example, the
          administrator can allocate persistent huge pages (for the
          appropriate OS) on the kernel boot command line by specifying the
          "hugepages=N" parameter at boot. With huge pages you also need to
          explicitly allocate the size.</para>

          <para>In HPCC Systems, there are three places in the configuration
          manager to set the attributes to use Huge Pages.</para>

          <para>There are attributes in each component, in the ECL Agent
          attributes, in Roxie attributes, and in Thor attributes. In each
          component there are two values:</para>

          HPCC Systems for the component(s) you wish.</para>
