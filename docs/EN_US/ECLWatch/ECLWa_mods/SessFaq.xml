  <title>Session Management</title>

  <para>The 7.0 release of HPCC Platform introduces the new ESP Session
  Management security feature. This functions like many banking applications,
  where after a configurable period of inactivity you are warned with a "You
  are about to be locked out" pop-up. If no action further is taken, the
  session is then locked and you would need to enter your credentials to
  unlock and resume. A session remains active while there is regular user
  interaction. After a period of inactivity, you are alerted that your session
  is about to be locked. Sessions are stored in cookies and are shared across
  tabs and instances of each browser. Activity in any instance will extend the
  entire session duration. Additionally, a Logout menu option allows you to
  close your session when you are finished.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">Q</emphasis>: Why did we implement this
        feature?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: The main motive is to
        tighten security. Browsers and the IDE left open after hours and over
        the weekend are a security risk. Additionally, this reduces
        unnecessary load on ESP since it will not auto refresh inactive
        ECLWatch sessions.</para>

        session last?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: Your administrator can
        configure this using Configuration Manager. The default setting is two
        hours of inactivity.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: No. You do not get logged
        out. Your session will get locked. Anything typed into any fields
        (such as a search box) that has not been submitted or entered could
        potentially be lost. However, since the session is only locked, it is
        unlikely that any data will be lost.</para>

        utilities be affected?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: Possibly. If you have
        configured AuthPerSessionOnly then command line utilities will not
        work. If AuthPerSessionOnly is not enabled then command line utilities
        will not be effected.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Q</emphasis>: Does auto refresh in
        ECLWatch reset the session expiration timer?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: No. Only active
        interactions like mouse clicks and pressing keys extend the timeout.
        Note that scrolling does not extend the expiration timer.</para>

        others?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: No, activity is tracked by
        your credentials. Activity in one tab or instance extends the session
        for all.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">Q</emphasis>: If I am logged in to the

        they share the same session timeout?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: No. Since each browser has
        its own cookie store, activity in one does not extend to the

        to the ECLWatch screen where I was when automatically locked
        out?</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: Yes. The intent is to lock
        your session and not completely log you out. Unlocking your session
        should return you to the same point when your session locked.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="strong">A</emphasis>: Maybe. If you have
        configured AuthPerSessionOnly then SOAP calls will not work. If your
        system is not configured that way, then programmatic SOAP calls
        continue to operate as they do now.</para>
