  <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Actions and Definitions</title><!-- DNT-End -->

  <para>While Definitions define expressions that may be evaluated, Actions
  trigger execution of a workunit that produces results that may be viewed. An
  Action may evaluate Definitions to produce its result. There are a number of
  built-in Actions in <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> (such as <!-- DNT-Start -->OUTPUT<!-- DNT-End -->), and any expression (without a
  Definition name) is implicitly treated as an Action to produce the result of
  the expression.</para>

  <sect2 id="Functions_as_ActionsFunctions_as_Actions">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Expressions as Actions<indexterm>
        <primary>Expressions as Actions</primary>
      </indexterm></title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>Fundamentally, any expression in can be treated as an Action. For
    example,</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>Attr1 := COUNT(Trades);     
Attr2 := MAX(Trades,trd_bal);
Attr3 := IF (1 = 0, 'A', 'B');</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>are all definitions, but without a definition name, they are simply
    expressions</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>COUNT(Trades);       //execute these expressions as Actions
MAX(Trades,trd_bal);
IF (1 = 0, 'A', 'B');</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>that are treated as actions, and as such, can directly generate
    result values by simply submitting them as queries to the supercomputer.
    Basically, any <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> expression can be used as an Action to instigate a
    workunit.</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Definitions as Actions<indexterm>
        <primary>Definitions as Actions</primary>
      </indexterm></title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>These same expression definitions can be executed by submitting the
    names of the Definitions as queries, like this:</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>Attr1; //These all generate the same result values
Attr2; // as the previous examples
Attr3;</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Actions as Definitions<indexterm>
        <primary>Actions as Definitions</primary>

    <para>Conversely, by simply giving any Action a Definition name it becomes
    a definition, therefore no longer a directly executable action. For
    example,</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>OUTPUT(Person);</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>is an action, but</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>Attr4 := OUTPUT(Person);</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>is a definition and does not immediately execute when submitted as
    part of a query. To execute the action inherent in the definition, you
    must execute the Definition name you've given to the Action, like
    this:</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>Attr4;    // run the previously defined OUTPUT(Person) action </programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="Debugging_Uses">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Debugging Uses</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>This technique of directly executing a Definition as an Action is
    useful when debugging complex <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> code. You can send the Definition as a
    query to determine if intermediate values are correctly calculated before
    continuing on with more complex code.</para>
