  <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Using the GROUP Function</title><!-- DNT-End -->

  <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> function provides important functionality when processing
  very large datasets. The basic concept is that the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> function will break
  the dataset up into a number of smaller subsets, but the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUPed<!-- DNT-End --> dataset is
  still treated as a single entity in your <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> code.</para>

  <para>Operations on a <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUPed<!-- DNT-End --> dataset are automatically performed on each
  subset, separately. Therefore, an operation on a <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUPed<!-- DNT-End --> dataset will appear
  in the <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> code as a single operation, but will in fact internally be
  accomplished by serially performing the same operation against each subset
  in turn. The advantage this approach has is that each individual operation
  is much smaller, and more likely to be able to be accomplished without
  spilling to disk, which means the total time to perform all the separate
  operations will typically be less than performing the same operation against
  the entire dataset (sometimes dramatically so).</para>

  <sect2 id="GROUP_vs_SORT">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>GROUP vs. SORT</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> function does not automatically sort the records itâs
    operating onâit will <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> based on the order of the records it is given.
    Therefore, SORTing the records first by the field(s) on which you want to
    <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> is usually done (except in circumstances where the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> field(s)
    are used only to break a single large operation up into a number of much
    smaller operations).</para>

    <para>For the set of operations that use <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End --> functions (such as
    <!-- DNT-Start -->ITERATE<!-- DNT-End -->, <!-- DNT-Start -->PROJECT<!-- DNT-End -->, <!-- DNT-Start -->ROLLUP<!-- DNT-End -->, etc), operating on a <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUPed<!-- DNT-End --> dataset where the
    operation is performed on each fragment (group) in the recordset,
    independently, implies that testing for boundary conditions will be
    different than if you were working with a <!-- DNT-Start -->SORTed<!-- DNT-End --> dataset. For example, the
    following code (contained in GROUPfunc.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->) uses the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> function to
    rank people's accounts, based on the open date and balance. The account
    with the newest open date is ranked highest (if there are multiple
    accounts opened the same day the one with the highest balance is used).
    There is no boundary check needed in the <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End --> function because the
    <!-- DNT-Start -->ITERATE<!-- DNT-End --> starts over again with each person, so the L.Ranking field value
    for each new person group is zero (0).</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>IMPORT $;

accounts := $.DeclareData.Accounts;

rec := RECORD
  accounts.PersonID;
  accounts.Account;
  accounts.opendate;
  accounts.balance;
  UNSIGNED1 Ranking := 0;
END;

tbl := TABLE(accounts,rec);

rec RankGrpAccts(rec L, rec R) := TRANSFORM
  SELF.Ranking := L.Ranking + 1;
  SELF := R;
END;
GrpRecs  := SORT(GROUP(SORT(tbl,PersonID),PersonID),-Opendate,-Balance);
i1 := ITERATE(GrpRecs,RankGrpAccts(LEFT,RIGHT));
OUTPUT(i1);
</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The following code just uses <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> to achieve the same record order
    as in the previous code. Notice the boundary check code in the <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End -->
    function. This is required, since the <!-- DNT-Start -->ITERATE<!-- DNT-End --> will perform a single
    operation against the entire dataset.:</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>rec RankSrtAccts(rec L, rec R) := TRANSFORM
  SELF.Ranking := IF(L.PersonID = R.PersonID,L.Ranking + 1, 1);
  SELF := R;
END;
SortRecs := SORT(tbl,PersonID,-Opendate,-Balance);
i2 := ITERATE(SortRecs,RankSrtAccts(LEFT,RIGHT));
OUTPUT(i2);
</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The different bounds checking in each is required by the fragmenting
    created by the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> function. The <!-- DNT-Start -->ITERATE<!-- DNT-End --> operates separately on each
    fragment in the first example, and operates on the entire record set in
    the second.</para>

  <sect2 id="PG_Performance_Considerations">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Performance Considerations</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>There is also a major performance advantage to using the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End -->
    function. For example, the <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> is an <emphasis>n log n</emphasis>
    operation, so breaking large record sets up into smaller sets of sets can
    dramatically improve the amount of time it takes to perform the sorting
    operation.</para>

    <para>Assuming that a dataset contains 1 billion 1,000-byte records
    (1,000,000,000) and you're operating on a 100-node supercomputer. Assuming
    also that the data is evenly distributed, then you have 10 million records
    per node occupying 1 gigabyte of memory on each node. Suppose you need to
    sort the data by three fields: by personID, opendate, and balance. You
    could achieve the result three possible ways: a global <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End -->, a distributed
    local <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End -->, or a <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUPed<!-- DNT-End --> distributed local <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End -->.</para>

    <para>Here's an example that demonstrates all three methods (contained in
    GROUPfunc.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->):</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>bf := NORMALIZE(accounts,
                CLUSTERSIZE * 2,
                TRANSFORM(RECORDOF(ProgGuide.Accounts),
                          SELF := LEFT));
ds0 := DISTRIBUTE(bf,RANDOM()) : PERSIST('~PROGGUIDE::PERSIST::TestGroupSort');
ds1 := DISTRIBUTE(ds,HASH32(personid));

// do a global sort
s1 := SORT(ds0,personid,opendate,-balance);
a  := OUTPUT(s1,,'~PROGGUIDE::EXAMPLEDATA::TestGroupSort1',OVERWRITE);

// do a distributed local sort
s3  := SORT(ds1,personid,opendate,-balance,LOCAL);
b   := OUTPUT(s3,,'~PROGGUIDE::EXAMPLEDATA::TestGroupSort2',OVERWRITE);

// do a grouped local sort
s4 := SORT(ds1,personid,LOCAL);
g2 := GROUP(s4,personid,LOCAL);
s5 := SORT(g2,opendate,-balance);
c  := OUTPUT(s5,,'~PROGGUIDE::EXAMPLEDATA::TestGroupSort3',OVERWRITE);
SEQUENTIAL(a,b,c);
</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The result sets for all of these <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> operations are identical.
    However, the time it takes to produce them is not. The above example
    operates only on 10 million 46-byte records per node, not the one billion
    1,000-byte records previously mentioned, but it certainly illustrates the
    techniques.</para>

    <para>For the hypothetical one billion record example, the performance of
    the Global Sort is calculated by the formula: 1 billion times the log of 1
    billion (9), resulting in a performance metric of 9 billion. The
    performance of Distributed Local Sort is calculated by the formula: 10
    million times the log of 10 million (7), resulting in a performance metric
    of 70 million. Assuming the <!-- DNT-Start -->GROUP<!-- DNT-End --> operation created 1,000 sub-groups on
    each node, the performance of Grouped Local Sort is calculated by the
    formula: 1,000 times (10,000 times the log of 10,000 (4)), resulting in a
    performance metric of 40 million.</para>

    <para>The performance metric numbers themselves are meaningless, but their
    ratios do indicate the difference in performance you can expect to see
    between <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> methods. This means that the distributed local <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> will be
    roughly 128 times faster than the global <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> (9 billion / 70 million) and
    the grouped <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> will be roughly 225 times faster than the global <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> (9
    billion / 40 million) and the grouped <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> will be about 1.75 times faster
    than the distributed local <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End --> (70 million / 40 million).</para>
