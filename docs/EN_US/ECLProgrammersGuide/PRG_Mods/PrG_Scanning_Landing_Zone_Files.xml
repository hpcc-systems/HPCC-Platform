  <title><emphasis>Scanning Landing Zone Files</emphasis></title>

  <para>Here's the scenario--you've just received a data file from someone and
  it has been put on your landing zone. Before you spray that file to your
  Thor cluster and start to work with it, you want to have a quick look to see
  exactly what kind of data it contains and whether the format of that data
  matches the format that you were given by the supplier. There are a number
  of ways to do this, including mapping a drive to your landing zone and using
  a text/hex editor to open the file and look at the contents.</para>

  <para>This article will show you how to accomplish this from within the ECL
  IDE using ECL. Here's the code (contained in the DeclareData MODULE
  attribute):</para>

  <programlisting>EXPORT MAC_ScanFile(IP, infile, scansize) := MACRO
  ds := DATASET(Std.File.ExternalLogicalFileName(IP, infile),{DATA1 S},THOR )[1..scansize];
  OUTPUT(TABLE(ds,{hex := ds.s,txt := (STRING1)ds.s}),ALL);
  Rec := RECORD
    UNSIGNED2 C;
    DATA S {MAXLENGTH(8*1024)};
  END;
  Rec XF1(ds L,INTEGER C) := TRANSFORM
    SELF.C := C;
    SELF.S := L.s;
  END;

  ds2 := PROJECT(ds,XF1(LEFT,COUNTER));
  Rec XF2(Rec L,Rec R) := TRANSFORM
    SELF.S := L.S[1 .. R.C-1] + R.S[1];
    SELF := L;
  END;
  Rolled := ROLLUP(ds2,TRUE,XF2(LEFT,RIGHT));
  OUTPUT(TRANSFER(Rolled[1].S,STRING));
ENDMACRO;
</programlisting>

  <para>This is written as a MACRO because you could have multiple Landing
  Zones, and you certainly are going to want to look into different files each
  time. Therefore, a MACRO that generates the standard process code to scan
  the file is precisely what's needed here.</para>

  <para>This MACRO takes three parameters: the IP of the landing zone
  containing the file the fully-qualified path to that file on the landing
  zone the number of bytes to read (maximum 8K)</para>

  <para>The initial DATASET declaration uses the
  Std.File.ExternalLogicalFileName function to name the file. Defining the
  RECORD structure as a single DATA1 field is necessary to ensure that both
  text and binary fields can be read correctly. Specifying the DATASET as a
  THOR file (no matter what type of file it actually is) makes it simple to
  read as a fixed-length record file. The square brackets at the end of the
  DATASET declaration automatically limit the number of 1-byte records read to
  the first <emphasis>scansize</emphasis> number of bytes in the file.</para>

  <para>The first OUTPUT action allows you to see the raw Hexadecimal data
  from the file.</para>

  <para>The TABLE function doubles up the input data, producing a DATA1
  displaying the Hex value and a STRING1 that type casts each byte to a
  STRING1 for display. Viewing the raw Hex value is necessary because most
  binary fields will not contain text-displayable characters (and those that
  do may mislead you as to the actual contents of the field). Non-displayable
  binary characters show up as a square box in the text column display.</para>

  <para>Next, we'll construct a more text-friendly view of the data. To do
  that we'll start with the Rec RECORD structure, which defines a byte-counter
  field (UNSIGNED2 C) and a variable-length field (DATA S {MAXLENGTH(8*1024)}
  to contain the text representation of the data as a single horizontal line
  of text.</para>

  <para>The XF1 TRANSFORM and its associated PROJECT moves the data from the
  input format into the format needed to roll up that data into a single text
  string. Adding the byte-counter field is necessary to ensure that blank
  spaces are not accidentally trimmed out of the final display.</para>

  <para>The XF2 TRANSFORM and its associated ROLLUP function performs the
  actual data append. The TRUE condition parameter ensures that only one
  record will result containing all the input bytes rolled into a single
  record.</para>

  <para>The last OUTPUT action uses the TRANSFER function instead of type
  casting to ensure that all the text characters in the original data are
  accurately represented.</para>

  <para>You call this MACRO like this:</para>

  <programlisting>IMPORT ProgrammersGuide AS PG;
PG.DeclareData.MAC_ScanFile( '10.173.9.4','C:\\training\\import\\BOCA.XML', 200);
</programlisting>

  <para>When viewing the result, the ECL IDE Result_1 tab displays a column of
  hexadecimal values and the text character (if any) next to it in the second
  column. This byte-by-byte view of the data is designed to allow you to see
  the raw Hexadecimal values of each byte alongside its text representation.
  This is the primary view to use when looking at the contents of files
  containing binary data.</para>

  <para>The ECL IDE Result_2 tab displays a single record with a single field.
  You can click on that field to highlight it, right-click and select "Copy"
  from the popup menu, then paste the text into any text editor to view.
  Binary fields will appear as square blocks or "garbage" characters,
  depending on their hex value. Once pasted into a text editor, you can easily
  look for data patterns that indicate the start for fields or records and
  validate that the data layout information provided by the data vendor is
  accurate (or not).</para>
