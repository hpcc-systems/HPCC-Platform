  <!-- DNT-Start --><title>SOAPCALL from Thor to Roxie</title><!-- DNT-End -->

  <para>Once you have your <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAP<!-- DNT-End -->-enabled queries tested and deployed to Roxie,
  you need to be able to use them. Many Roxie queries can be launched through
  some specially-designed user interface that allow end-users to enter search
  criteria and get results, one at a time. However, sometimes you need to
  retrieve data in a batch mode, where the same query is run once against each
  record from a dataset. That makes Thor a candidate to be the requesting
  platform, by using <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End -->.</para>

    <para>This example shows how you would make a <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> to the service
    passing it a single set of parameters to retrieve only those records that
    relate to the set of passed parameters. The service receives a single set
    of input data and returns only those records that meet that criteria. The
    expected result from this query is a returned set of the 1000 records
    whose LastName field contains â<!-- DNT-Start -->KLYDE<!-- DNT-End -->.â</para>

    <para>This example passes a dataset containing multiple sets of parameters
    on which the service will operate, returning a single recordset of all
    records returned by each set of parameters. In this form, the <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End -->
    function allows the <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> to operate like a <!-- DNT-Start -->PROJECT<!-- DNT-End --> to produce the
    input records that provide the input parameters for the service.</para>

    <para>The service operates on each record in the input dataset in turn,
    combining the results from each into a single return result set. The
    <!-- DNT-Start -->ONFAIL<!-- DNT-End --> option indicates that if there is any type of error, then the
    record should simply by skipped. The expected result from this query is a
    returned set of three records for the only three records that match the
    input criteria (<!-- DNT-Start -->CISSY<!-- DNT-End --> <!-- DNT-Start -->TRAYLOR<!-- DNT-End -->, <!-- DNT-Start -->CLYDE<!-- DNT-End --> <!-- DNT-Start -->KLYDE<!-- DNT-End -->, and <!-- DNT-Start -->PERCIVAL<!-- DNT-End --> <!-- DNT-Start -->BOWEN<!-- DNT-End -->).</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Performance Considerations: PARALLEL</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The form of the first example takes a single row as its input. When
    a single <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> is specified, <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> sends the request to that one <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> and
    waits for a response. If multiple URLs are specified, <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> sends a
    request to the first <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> in the list, waits for a response, sends a
    request to the second <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End -->, and on down the list. The <!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End --> option
    controls concurrency, so if <!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End -->(<emphasis>n</emphasis>) is specified,
    requests are sent concurrently from each Thor node, with up to
    <emphasis>n</emphasis> requests in flight at once from each node.</para>

    <para>The form of the second example takes a dataset as its input. When a
    single <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> specified, the default behaviour is to send two requests with
    the first and second rows concurrently, wait for a response, send the
    third rows, and so on down the dataset, with up to two requests in flight
    at once. If <!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End -->(<emphasis>n</emphasis>) is specified, it sends
    <emphasis>n</emphasis> requests with the first <emphasis>n</emphasis> rows
    concurrently from each Thor node, and so on, with up to
    <emphasis>n</emphasis> requests in flight at once from each node.</para>

    <para>In an ideal world you would specify a <!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End --> value that multiplies
    out to at least the number of Roxie URLs, so that every available host can
    work simultaneously. Also, if you're using a dataset as input, you might
    want to try a value several times the number of URLs. However, this could
    cause network contention (timeouts and dropped connections) if set too
    high.</para>

    <para>You should add the <!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End --> option to the code from both previous
    examples to see what effect differing values may have in your
    environment.</para>

  <sect2 id="Performance_Considerations_MERGE">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>Performance Considerations: MERGE</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End --> option controls the number of rows per request for the
    form that takes a dataset (<!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End --> does not apply to the forms of <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End -->
    that take a single row as input). If <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End -->(<emphasis>m</emphasis>) is
    specified, each request contains up to <emphasis>m</emphasis> rows, rather
    than a single row.</para>

    <para>If the concurrency (<!-- DNT-Start -->PARALLEL<!-- DNT-End --> option setting) is less than or equal
    to the number of URLs then each <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> will normally only see one request at
    a time (assuming all hosts operate at about the same speed). In that case,
    you might choose a value of <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End --> as high as the host and the network can
    take: too high a value and a massive request might kill or swamp the
    service, but too low a value needlessly increases overhead by sending many
    small requests in place of fewer larger ones. If the concurrency is
    greater than the number of URLs then each <!-- DNT-Start -->URL<!-- DNT-End --> will see several requests at
    a time and these considerations still apply.</para>

    <para>Assuming that the host processes a single request serially, there is
    one additional consideration. You should ensure that the <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End --> value is
    smaller than the number of rows in the dataset so as to ensure that you
    are making use of the parallelization on the hosts. If the value of <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End -->
    is greater than or equal to the number of input rows, then you send the
    entire input dataset in one request and the host processes the rows
    serially.</para>

    <para>You should add the <!-- DNT-Start -->MERGE<!-- DNT-End --> option to the code from the second example
    to see what effect differing values may have in your environment.</para>

  <sect2 id="A_Real_World_Example">
    <!-- DNT-Start --><title>A Real World Example</title><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>A customer asked for help with a problemâhow to compare two strings
    and determine if the first contains every word in the second, in any
    order, when there are an indeterminate number of words in each string.
    This is a fairly straight-forward problem in <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->. Using <!-- DNT-Start -->JOIN<!-- DNT-End --> and <!-- DNT-Start -->ROLLUP<!-- DNT-End -->
    would be one approach, or nested child dataset queries (not supported in
    Thor at the time of the request for help, though they may be by the time
    you read this). All the following code is contained in the Soapcall3.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->
    file.</para>

    <para>The first need was to create a function that would extract all the
    discrete words from a string. This is the kind of job that the <!-- DNT-Start -->PARSE<!-- DNT-End -->
    function excels at, so that's exactly what this code does:</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>ParseWords(STRING LineIn) := FUNCTION
  PATTERN Ltrs := PATTERN('[A-Za-z]');
  PATTERN Char := Ltrs | '-' | '\'';
  TOKEN   Word := Char+;
          ds   := DATASET([{LineIn}],{STRING line});
  RETURN PARSE(ds,line,Word,{STRING Pword := MATCHTEXT(Word)});
END;</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>This <!-- DNT-Start -->FUNCTION<!-- DNT-End --> (contained in Soapcall3.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->) receives an input string
    and produces a record set result of all the words contained in that
    string. It defines a <!-- DNT-Start -->PATTERN<!-- DNT-End --> attribute (Char) of allowable characters in a
    word as the set of all upper and lower case letters (defined by the Ltrs
    <!-- DNT-Start -->PATTERN<!-- DNT-End -->), the hyphen, and the apostrophe. Any other character than these
    will be ignored.</para>

    <para>Next, it defines a Word as one or more allowable Char pattern
    characters. This pattern is defined as a <!-- DNT-Start -->TOKEN<!-- DNT-End --> so that only the full word
    match is returned and not all the possible alternative matches (i.e.
    returning just <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAP<!-- DNT-End -->, instead of <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAP<!-- DNT-End -->, <!-- DNT-Start -->SOA<!-- DNT-End -->, <!-- DNT-Start -->SO<!-- DNT-End -->, and Sâall the possible
    alternative matches that a <!-- DNT-Start -->PATTERN<!-- DNT-End --> would generate).</para>

    <para>The one record in-line <!-- DNT-Start -->DATASET<!-- DNT-End --> attribute (ds) creates the input
    âfileâ for the <!-- DNT-Start -->PARSE<!-- DNT-End --> function to work on, producing the result record set
    of all the discrete words from the input string.</para>

    <para>Next, we need a Roxie query to compare the two strings (also
    contained in Soapcall3.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->):</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>EXPORT Soapcall3() := FUNCTION
  STRING UID     := '' : STORED('UIDstr');
  STRING LeftIn  := '' : STORED('LeftInStr');
  STRING RightIn := '' : STORED('RightInStr');
  BOOLEAN TokenMatch := FUNCTION
    P1 := ParseWords(LeftIn);
    P2 := ParseWords(RightIn);
    SetSrch := SET(P1,Pword);
    ProjRes := PROJECT(P2,
                       TRANSFORM({BOOLEAN Fnd},
                                 SELF.Fnd := LEFT.Pword IN SetSrch));
    AllRes  := DEDUP(SORT(ProjRes,Fnd));
    RETURN COUNT(AllRes) = 1 AND AllRes[1].Fnd = TRUE;
  END;
  RETURN OUTPUT(DATASET([{UID,TokenMatch}],{STRING UID,BOOLEAN res}));
END;</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>There are three pieces of data this query expects to receive: a
    string containing an identifier for the comparison (for context purposes
    in the result), and the two strings whose words to compare.</para>

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->FUNCTION<!-- DNT-End --> passes the input strings to the ParseWords function to
    create two recordsets of words from those strings. The <!-- DNT-Start -->SET<!-- DNT-End --> function then
    re-defines the first recordset as a <!-- DNT-Start -->SET<!-- DNT-End --> so the the <!-- DNT-Start -->IN<!-- DNT-End --> operator may be
    used.</para>

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->PROJECT<!-- DNT-End --> operation does all the real work. It passes each word in
    turn from the second input string to its inline <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End --> function, which
    produces a Boolean result for that wordâ<!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End --> or <!-- DNT-Start -->FALSE<!-- DNT-End -->, is it present in
    the set of words from the first input string or not?</para>

    <para>To determine if all the words in the second string were contained in
    the first, the <!-- DNT-Start -->SORT<!-- DNT-End -->/<!-- DNT-Start -->DEDUP<!-- DNT-End --> sorts all the resulting Boolean values then
    removes all the duplicate entries. There will only be one or two records
    left: either a <!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End --> and a <!-- DNT-Start -->FALSE<!-- DNT-End -->, or a single <!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End --> or <!-- DNT-Start -->FALSE<!-- DNT-End --> record.</para>

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->RETURN<!-- DNT-End --> expression detects which of the three scenarios has
    occurred. Two records left indicates some, but not all, of the words were
    present. One record indicates either all or none of the words were
    present, and if the value of that record is <!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End -->, then all words were
    present and the <!-- DNT-Start -->FUNCTION<!-- DNT-End --> returns <!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End -->. All other cases return
    <!-- DNT-Start -->FALSE<!-- DNT-End -->.</para>

    <para>The <!-- DNT-Start -->OUTPUT<!-- DNT-End --> uses a one-record inline <!-- DNT-Start -->DATASET<!-- DNT-End --> to format the result.
    The identifier that was passed in is passed back along with the Boolean
    result of the compare. The identifier becomes important when the query is
    called multiple times in Roxie to process through a dataset of strings to
    compare in a batch mode because the results may not be returned in the
    same order as the input records. If it were only ever used interactively,
    this identifier would not be necessary.</para>

    <para>Once you've saved the query to the Repository, you can test it with
    hThor and/or deploy it to Roxie (hThor will work for testing, but Roxie is
    much faster for production). Either way, you can use <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> to access it
    like this (the only difference would be the <!-- DNT-Start -->IP<!-- DNT-End --> and port you target for the
    query (contained in Soapcall4.<!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End -->)):</para>

    <!-- DNT-Start --><programlisting>RoxieIP := 'http://127.0.0.1:8002/WsEcl/soap/query/roxie/soapcall3.1'; //Roxie
svc     := 'soapcall3.1';

InRec := RECORD
  STRING UIDstr{XPATH('UIDstr')}; 
  STRING LeftInStr{XPATH('LeftInStr')};
  STRING RightInStr{XPATH('RightInStr')};
END;
InDS := DATASET([
   {'1','the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy red dog','quick fox red dog'},
   {'2','the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy red dog','quick fox black dog'},
   {'3','george of the jungle lives here','fox black dog'},
   {'4','fred and wilma flintstone','fred flintstone'},
   {'5','yomama comeonah','brake chill'} ],InRec);

RS := SOAPCALL(InDS,
               RoxieIP,
               svc,
               InRec,
               TRANSFORM(LEFT),
               DATASET({STRING UIDval{XPATH('uid')},BOOLEAN CompareResult{XPATH('res')}}));

OUTPUT(RS);
</programlisting><!-- DNT-End -->

    <para>Of course, <emphasis role="bold">you must first change the <!-- DNT-Start -->IP<!-- DNT-End --> and
    port in this code to the correct values for your environment</emphasis>.
    You can find the proper <!-- DNT-Start -->IP<!-- DNT-End --> and port to use by looking at the System
    Servers page of your <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> Watch. To target Doxie (aka <!-- DNT-Start -->ECL<!-- DNT-End --> Agent or hthor),
    use the <!-- DNT-Start -->IP<!-- DNT-End --> of your Thor's <!-- DNT-Start -->ESP<!-- DNT-End --> Server and the port for its wsecl service.
    To target Roxie, use the <!-- DNT-Start -->IP<!-- DNT-End --> of your Roxie's <!-- DNT-Start -->ESP<!-- DNT-End --> Server and the port for
    its wsecl service. It's possible that both <!-- DNT-Start -->ESP<!-- DNT-End --> servers could be on the
    same box. If so, then the difference will only be in the port assignment
    for each.</para>

    <para>The key to this <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> query is the InRec <!-- DNT-Start -->RECORD<!-- DNT-End --> structure with
    its <!-- DNT-Start -->XPATH<!-- DNT-End --> definitions. These must exactly match the part names and the
    <!-- DNT-Start -->STORED<!-- DNT-End --> names of the query's parameter receiving attributes (<!-- DNT-Start -->NB<!-- DNT-End --> that these
    are case sensitive, since <!-- DNT-Start -->XPATH<!-- DNT-End --> is <!-- DNT-Start -->XML<!-- DNT-End --> and <!-- DNT-Start -->XML<!-- DNT-End --> is always case sensitive).
    This is what maps the input data fields through the <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAP<!-- DNT-End --> interface to the
    query's attributes.</para>

    <para>This <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAPCALL<!-- DNT-End --> receives a recordset as input and produces a recordset
    as its result, making it very similar to the second example above. One
    small change from that previous example of this type is the use of the
    shorthand <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End --> instead of an inline <!-- DNT-Start -->TRANSFORM<!-- DNT-End --> function. Also, note
    that the <!-- DNT-Start -->XPATH<!-- DNT-End --> for the first field in the <!-- DNT-Start -->DATASET<!-- DNT-End --> parameter's inline
    <!-- DNT-Start -->RECORD<!-- DNT-End --> structure contains lower case âuidâ while it is obviously
    referencing the query's <!-- DNT-Start -->OUTPUT<!-- DNT-End --> field named âUIDââthe <!-- DNT-Start -->XML<!-- DNT-End --> returned from the
    <!-- DNT-Start -->SOAP<!-- DNT-End --> service uses lower case tag names for the returned data
    fields.</para>

    <para>When you run this you'll get a <!-- DNT-Start -->TRUE<!-- DNT-End --> result for records one and four,
    and <!-- DNT-Start -->FALSE<!-- DNT-End --> for all others.</para>
