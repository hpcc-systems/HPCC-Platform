    <para>The code that generates the example data used by all the
    <emphasis>Programmer's Guide</emphasis> articles is contained in a file
    named Gendata.ECL. You simply need to open that file in the ECL IDE
    (select <emphasis role="bold">File &gt; Open</emphasis> from the menu,
    select the Gendata.ECL file, and it will open in a Builder window) then
    press the <emphasis role="bold">Submit</emphasis> button to generate the
    data files. The process takes a couple of minutes to run. Here is the
    code, fully explained.</para>

TotalParents := P_Mult1 * P_Mult2;
TotalChildren := 5000000;</programlisting>

    <para>These constants define the numbers used to generate 1,000,000 parent
    records and 5,000,000 child records. By defining these once as attributes
    the code could be easily made to generate a smaller number of parent
    records (such as 10,000 by changing both multipliers from 1000 to 100).
    However, the code as written is designed for a maximum of 1,000,000 parent
    records and would have to be changed in several places to accommodate
    generating more. The number of child records can be changed either
    direction without any other changes to the code (although if pushed too
    far upward you may encounter runtime errors regarding the maximum variable
    record length for the nested child dataset). For the purposes of
    demonstrating the techniques in these <emphasis>Programmer's
    Guide</emphasis> articles, 1,000,000 parent and 5,000,000 child records
    are more than sufficient.</para>

    <para>Here is the beginning of the data generation code. The BlankSet is a
    single empty "seed" record, used to start the process. The CountCSZ
    attribute simply defines the maximum number of city, state, zip
    combinations that are available for use in subsequent calculations that
    will determine which to use in a given record.</para>

                           INTEGER W) := TRANSFORM
  SELF.FirstName := IF(W=1,SetFnames[C],L.FirstName);
  SELF.LastName  := IF(W=2,SetLnames[C],L.LastName);
  SELF := L;
END;

base_fn  := NORMALIZE(BlankSet,P_Mult1,CreateRecs(LEFT,COUNTER,1));

base_fln := NORMALIZE(base_fn ,P_Mult2,CreateRecs(LEFT,COUNTER,2));
</programlisting>

    <para>The purpose of this code is to generate 1,000,000 unique first/last
    name records as a starting point. The NORMALIZE operation is unique in
    that its second parameter defines the number of times to call the
    TRANSFORM function for each input record. This makes it uniquely suited to
    generating the kind of "bogus" data we need.</para>

    <para>We're doing two NORMALIZE operations here. The first generates 1,000
    records with unique first names from the single blank record in the
    BlankSet inline DATASET. Then the second takes the 1,000 records from the
    first NORMALIZE and creates 1,000 new records with unique last names for
    each input record, resulting in 1,000,000 unique first/last name
    records.</para>

    <para>One interesting "trick" here is the use of a single TRANSFORM
    function for both of the NORMALIZE operations. Defining the TRANSFORM to
    receive one "extra" (third) parameter than it normally takes is what
    allows this. This parameter simply flags which NORMALIZE pass the
    TRANSFORM is doing.</para>

  SELF.City          := SetCity[CSZ_Rec];
  SELF.State         := SetStates[CSZ_Rec];
  SELF.Zip           := SetZips[CSZ_Rec];
  SELF               := R;
END;

base_fln_dist := DISTRIBUTE(base_fln,HASH32(FirstName,LastName));

base_people   := ITERATE(base_fln_dist,
                         PopulateRecs(LEFT,
                         RIGHT,
                         HASHCRC(RIGHT.FirstName,RIGHT.LastName)),
                         LOCAL);

base_people_dist := DISTRIBUTE(base_people,HASH32(PersonID));
</programlisting>

    <para>Once the two NORMALIZE operations have done their work, the next
    task is to populate the rest of the fields. Since one of those fields is
    the PersonID, which is the unique identifier field for the record, the
    fastest way to populate it is with ITERATE using the LOCAL option. Using
    the Thorlib.Node() function and CLUSTERSIZE compiler directive, you can
    uniquely number each record in parallel on each node with ITERATE. You may
    end up with a few holes in the numbering towards the end, but since the
    only requirement here is uniqueness and not contiguity, those holes are
    irrelevant. Since the first two NORMALIZE operations took place on a
    single node (look at the data skews shown in the ECL Watch graph), the
    first thing to do is DISTRIBUTE the records so each node has a
    proportional chunk of the data to work with. Then the ITERATE can do its
    work on each chunk of records in parallel.</para>

    <para>To introduce an element of randomity to the data choices, the
    ITERATE passes a hash value to the TRANSFORM function as an "extra" third
    parameter. This is the same technique used previously, but passing
    calculated values instead of constants.</para>

    <para>The CSZ_Rec attribute definition illustrates the use of local
    attribute definitions inside TRANSFORM functions. Defining the expression
    once, then using it multiple times as needed to produce a valid city,
    state, zip combination. The rest of the fields are populated by data
    selected using the passed in hash value in their expressions. The modulus
    division operator (%--produces the remainder of the division) is used to
    ensure that a value is calculated that is in the valid range of the number
    of elements for the given set of data from which the field is
    populated.</para>

    <para>This process is similar to the one used for the parent records. This
    time, instead of passing in a hash value, a local attribute does that work
    inside the TRANSFORM. Just as before, the hash value is used to select the
    actual data to go in each field of the record.</para>

    <para>The interesting bit here is the expression to determine the PersonID
    field value. Since we're generating 5,000,000 child records it would be
    very simple to just give each parent five children. However, real-world
    data rarely looks like that. Therefore, the CHOOSE function is used to
    select a different method for each set of a million child records. The
    first million uses the first IF expression, and the second million uses
    the second, and so on... This creates a varying number of children for
    each parent, ranging from one to nine.</para>

    <para>Now that we have separate recordsets of parent and child records,
    the next step is to combine them into a single dataset with each parent's
    child data nested within the same physical record as the parent. The
    reason for nesting the child data this way is to allow easy parent-child
    queries in the Data Refinery and Rapid data Delivery Engine without
    requiring the use of separate JOIN steps to make the links between the
    parent and child records.</para>

    <para>To build the nested child dataset requires the DENORMALIZE
    operation. This operation finds the links between the parent records and
    their associated children, calling the TRANSFORM function as many times as
    there are child records for each parent. The interesting technique here is
    the use of the ROW function to construct each additional nested child
    record. This is done to eliminate the linking field (PersonID) from each
    child record stored in the combined dataset, since it is the same value as
    contained in the parent record's PersonID field.</para>

    <para>By using a MODULE structure as a container, all the DATASET and

    maintenance and update simple while allowing complete access to them
