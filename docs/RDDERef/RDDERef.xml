    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Roxie engine - also known as the Rapid Data Delivery Engine or
    RDDE - uses a combination of technologies and techniques that produce
    extremely fast throughput for queries on indexed data housed in a
    dedicated High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC).</para>

    <para>Roxie queries can exceed several thousand a second, compared to Thor
    queries which tend to take from a few seconds to a few minutes each (from
    end to end) depending on the complexity of the query.</para>

    <para>To fully understand this concept, it is best to look at the purpose
    for which each of these processes is designed:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>
        <para>The Thor platform is designed to perform operations on every
        record (or most records) in a massive dataset.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Queries can be run on the hThor platform if they can quickly
        pinpoint small sets of records within the data.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Roxie queries are typically used to quickly pinpoint small sets
        of records over and over again.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you think of all your data as an ocean, Thor would be used to
    perform operations on the entire ocean.</para>

    <para>An hThor query might be used to find a single fish within that sea
    of data.</para>

    <para>The query would be deployed to a Roxie cluster to be used to find
    hundreds or thousands of individual fish-one after another.</para>

    <para>Roxie queries are deployed to a Roxie cluster, which pre-loads all
    queries into memory and prepares them to be ready to execute as soon as a
    query is received.</para>

    <para>Queries are sent to Roxie via XML, SOAP, or JSON, and the results
    are returned in the same format. A client can communicate directly with
    the Roxie cluster by opening a socket to one of the servers in the
    cluster, or it can communicate via an ESP service such as WsECL.</para>

    <sect1 id="Roxie_Overview">
      <title>Roxie Overview</title>

        <title>When to Use Indexes</title>

        <para>The Thor platform is designed to perform operations quickly on
        massive datasets without indexes, where the entire dataset (or almost
        all of it) is to be used. However, if only a few records are needed,
        an index can access them more efficiently. In the ECL language, an
        index behaves just like a dataset that happens to be able to implement
        certain functions (typically filter and count functions) much more
        quickly than a standard flat file or CSV dataset can.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Payload_INDEXes">
      <title>Payload INDEXes</title>

      <para>In conventional database systems, an index is used together with a
      data file to locate records in that data file. You can do the same in
      ECL by storing file positions in the index and using them in a FETCH
      function to retrieve the corresponding data rows from the original
      file.</para>

      <para>However, because you can store whatever fields you wish in an
      index, it is more common in Roxie queries to design indexes that store
      both the search fields and the information you want to look up. This
      eliminates an extra disk read for the FETCH. Since indexes are
      compressed, this can also save disk space if the original data file does
      not need to be stored on the Roxie cluster.</para>

      <para>Any field in an index that does not need to be searched for can be
      specified as being in the "payload" - such fields are stored only at the
      leaf nodes of the index tree which can save some space and performance
      in the lookups. The fields in the payload may simply be additional
      fields from the base dataset, but they may also contain the result of
      some preliminary computation (computed fields).</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Roxie_Superfiles">
      <title>Roxie Superfiles</title>

      <para>A superfile used in Roxie may not contain more than a single
      sub-file (a superkey, however, may contain multiple payload indexes).
      This restriction makes using superfiles in Roxie just an exercise in
      file redirection. By writing queries that use superfiles (even though
      they contain only a single sub-file) you have the advantage of being
      able to update your Roxie by simply deploying new data without needing
      to re-compile the queries that use that data simply because the sub-file
      name changed. This saves compilation time, and in a production
      environment (which a Roxie typically is) where a data file is used by
      many queries, this savings can be a significant.</para>

      <para>See the <emphasis>ECL Programmer's Guide</emphasis> for more
      details.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="How-Roxie-Works">
      <title>How Roxie Works</title>

      <para>Roxie clusters consist of a number of machines connected together
      to function as a single entity. ECL source code for one or more queries
      is compiled and published to the cluster. Once published, queries can
      process data rapidly.</para>

      <para>Each machine in the cluster acts in two distinct roles - these
      roles execute in the same process and share a lot of code - including
      the compiled query code - but can be thought of as logically
      distinct.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Server</emphasis> process accepts
      incoming queries from a client, evaluates the ECL code of the query
      given the input that is provided in the client query, and returns the
      result to the client. When the Server evaluates an ECL function that
      requires data from disk, it determines the slave node or nodes that may
      have the appropriate data, and sends a request to those slave nodes to
      retrieve any matching data. Results from multiple slave nodes are
      collated and become the input for further ECL functions evaluated on the
      Server node. Typically, requesting applications use some form of load
      balancing to distribute requests evenly to the available Servers.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Slave</emphasis> process accepts
      requests only from other Server nodes in the cluster. These requests
      correspond to a single ECL function such as a filtered index read or a
      disk fetch. Results are sent back to the Server that originally
      requested them. In order to balance performance and manage hardware
      failures, slaves receive the requests over multicast, and there will
      typically be at least two slave nodes that will receive each request
      from a server. The slave nodes communicate with each other to avoid
      duplicating effort, so that whichever slave is first able to handle the
      request tells the others not to bother. Each node in a cluster typically
      handles Slave requests on two or more multicast channels, usually one
      channel per disk drive. If any Slave node is not responding, the
      requests on that channel are handled by the other peer Slave nodes
      responsible for that channel.</para>

      <para></para>

      <para><graphic fileref="images/RM-02.jpg" /></para>

      <para>This example shows a 5-node Roxie Cluster with each node
      configured to be both a <emphasis role="bold">Server</emphasis> and a
      <emphasis role="bold">Slave</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Queries that have been compiled with the target platform specified
      as a Roxie cluster may be published to a QuerySet using EclWatch.</para>

      <para>Each Roxie cluster loads queries from one or more QuerySet
      lists.</para>

      <para>When a query is added to the QuerySet that a Roxie is watching,
      Roxie will preload the query .so (or .DLL) and prepare the execution
      context as far as it can, so that it is ready to execute incoming
      requests to execute that query as soon as they arrive. This may includes
      loading the .so (or .DLL), resolving file references, and opening files
      (if there are sufficient file handles available), preloading data into
      memory if requested, and evaluating ECL code in the query that has been
      marked as : ONCE.</para>

      <para>Depending on the configuration, Roxie may read data remotely from
      a Thor cluster where it was prepared, or if preferred, it may be copied
      to the Roxie for local access.</para>

      <para>Typically a development system might refer to data in situ on the
      Thor cluster, while a production system may prefer the performance
      benefits of copying data locally to the Roxie.</para>

      <para>Roxie can read data remotely while it is being copied and switch
      to the local copy once the copy operation is complete. This provides the
      benefit of quick availability because the query can be active before the
      data is copied, while still taking advantage of the performance benefits
      of local data.</para>

    <sect1 id="Roxie-Data-Backup">
      <title>Roxie Data Backup</title>

      <para>Roxie data is protected by three forms of redundancy:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para>Original Source Data File Retention: When a query is deployed,
          the data is typically copied from a Thor cluster's hard drives.
          Therefore, the Thor data can serve as backup, provided it is not
          removed or altered on Thor. Thor data is typically retained for a
          period of time sufficient to serve as a backup copy.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Peer-Node Redundancy: Each Slave node typically has one or
          more peer nodes within its cluster. Each peer stores a copy of data
          files it will read.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Sibling Cluster Redundancy: Although not required, Roxie
          deployments may run multiple identically-configured Roxie clusters.
          When two clusters are deployed for Production each node has an
          identical twin in terms of data and queries stored on the node in
          the other cluster.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><?dbfo-need height="8.75in"?>This configuration provides multiple
      redundant copies of data files. In this example, there are six copies of
      each file at any given time; eliminating the need to use traditional
      backup procedures for Roxie data files.</para>

      <title>Methods to Submit Jobs to a Roxie Cluster</title>

      <para>After a query is compiled and deployed, there are several methods
      to submit jobs that use the query. While the most common usage is via
      custom applications using the XML or SOAP interface, the other methods
      have valid uses, too.</para>

      <para>A direct socket connection can communicate directly with the Roxie
      cluster, eliminating all other intermediate components. This provides a
      means of certifying the Roxie cluster, its configuration, the deployment
      of the query, and the query itself.</para>

      <para>SOAPCALL allows a Thor query to make calls to a Roxie query (See
      the <emphasis>ECL Language Reference </emphasis>for details). This
      provides the capability of combining Roxie results with other data
      processing tasks performed during ETL.</para>

      <para>Conducting queries via an ESP service using HTTP or HTTPS allows
      access to queries directly from a browser. Web-based access allows you
      to provide easy access to anyone you wish. Using HTTPS, you can ensure
      data security using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. This ensures
      all data is encrypted as it travels across a network or the Internet. In
      addition, LDAP authentication is available to restrict access to a set
      of users.</para>

      <para>Custom applications using SOAP provides the most flexibility and
      functionality. The application development process is simplified by
      Enterprise Services Platform's automatic Web Services Definition
      Language (WSDL) generation. Many development tools (such as, Microsoft's
      .NET Studio or NetBeans JAVA) include a tool to generate code to create
      proxy stubs from a WSDL document. This simplifies the development
      process and ensures exposure of all necessary methods and
      properties.</para>

        same type and the same scope using the same spray options.</para>

        <para>Fixed (length) files can have different record lengths and XML
        files can have different row tags which must be specified individually

        to spray and the spray type. You will then see the files listed. Enter
        the record length or row tag information for each file if using the
        Fixed or XML spray types, then check all other applicable options and
        Spray.</para>

    <title>Capacity Planning for Roxie Clusters</title>

    <sect1 id="Capacity_Planning" role="nobrk">
      <title>Capacity Planning</title>

      <para>Roxie clusters are disk-based High Performance Computing Clusters
      (HPCC) , typically using indexed files. A cluster is capable of storing
      and manipulating as much data as its combined hard drive space; however,
      this does not produce optimal performance.</para>

      <para>For maximum performance, you should configure your cluster so
      slave nodes perform most jobs in memory.</para>

      <para>For example, if a query uses three data files with a combined file
      size of 60 GB, a 40-channel cluster is a good size, while a 60-channel
      is probably better.</para>

      <para>Another consideration is the size of the Thor cluster creating the
      data files and index files to be loaded. Your target Roxie cluster
      should be the same size as the Thor on which the data and index files
      are created or a number evenly divisible by the size of your Roxie
      cluster. For example, a 100-way Thor to a 20-way Roxie would be
      acceptable.</para>

      <para>This is due to the manner in which data is loaded and processed by
      Roxie slaves. If data is copied to slave nodes, the file parts are
      directly copied from source location to target locations. They are NOT
      split or resized to fit a different sized cluster. Therefore, if you
      load 50 file parts onto a 40-channel cluster, part one goes to channel
      one, part two to channel two, etc. Parts 41-50 start at the top again so
      that part 41 goes to channel 1, and part 42 goes to channel 2, etc. The
      result is an unevenly distributed workload and would result in reduced
      performance. A cluster will only perform as fast as its slowest
      node.</para>

      <para>The final consideration is the number of Server processes in a
      cluster. Each slave must also be a Server, but you can dedicate
      additional nodes to be only Server processes. This is useful for queries
      that require processing on the Server after results are returned from
      slaves. Those Server-intensive queries could be sent only to dedicated
      Server IP addresses so the load is removed from nodes acting as both
      Server and slave.</para>

      <sect2 id="Configuring_the_Channels">
        <title>Configuring the Channels</title>

        <para>In the illustration below, the nodes are configured using an N+5
        scheme to share channels. Channels can be configured in many ways,
        this is one example.</para>

        <para><graphic fileref="images/RM-15.jpg" /></para>

        <para>In this depiction, each enclosure holds five Roxie slave blades
        (a row of servers in the picture). We will use this example for the
        rest of this manual.</para>
