    <title>Using Configuration Manager</title>

    <para id="cfgmgr_introP0">Configuration Manager is the utility with which
    we configure the HPCC platform. The HPCC platform's configuration is
    stored in an XML file named <emphasis
    role="bold">environment.xml</emphasis>. Once you generate an environment
    (xml) file, it gets saved into a source directory (default is <emphasis
    role="bold">/etc/HPCCSystems/source</emphasis>). You then need to stop the
    system to copy it into the active HPCC directory, then distribute it into
    place on to each node and restart the HPCC system. At no time during
    configuration do you work on the live environment file.</para>

    <para id="cfgmgr_introP1">When you install the HPCC system package, a
    default single-node environment.xml file is generated. After that, you can
    use the Configuration Manager to modify it and/or create a different
    environment file to configure components, or add nodes. There is a
    Configuration Manager wizard to help create an environment file. Give any
    environment file you create a descriptive name that would indicate what it
    is for in the source. For example, you might create an environment without
    a Roxie, you could call that file
    <emphasis>environmentNoRoxie.xml</emphasis>.</para>

    <para id="cfgmgr_p1b">You would then copy the new configuration file you
    generate from the source directory to the <emphasis
    role="bold">/etc/HPCCSystems</emphasis> directory. Rename the file to
    environment.xml, and restart the system in order to reconfigure your
    system.</para>

    <para id="cfgmgr_introP2">Configuration Manager also offers an <emphasis
    role="bold">Advanced View</emphasis> which allows more granularity for you
    to add instances of components or change the default settings of
    components for more advanced users. Even if you plan to use the Advanced
    View, it is a good idea to start with a wizard generated configuration
    file and use Advanced View to edit it.</para>

    <para id="cfgmgr_introP3">More information and specific details for each
    Configuration Manager component and attributes of those components is
    detailed in <emphasis>Using Configuration Manager</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>The following sections will provide the details for configuring an
    HPCC environment using the Configuration Manager.</para>

      <title>Sample Sizings</title>

      <para>This section illustrates sample system sizings for various work
      environments. Unlike system requirements, the following samples are
      suggestions for setting up you system for various operating
      conditions.</para>

      <sect2 id="Sample-Size-HighDataVolume">
        <title>Sample Sizing for High Data volume (Typical)</title>

        <para>The most typical scenario for HPCC is utilizing it with a high
        volume of data. This suggested sample sizing would be appropriate for
        a site with large volumes of data. A good policy is to set the Thor
        size to 4 times the source data on your HPCC. Typically, Roxie would
        be about ¼ the size of Thor. This is because the data is compressed
        and the system does not hold any transient data in Roxie. Remember
        that you do not want the number of Roxie nodes to exceed the number of
        Thor nodes. </para>

        <sect3>
          <title>High Data Thor sizing considerations</title>

          <para>Each Thor node can hold about 2.5 TB of data (MAX), so plan
          for the number of Thor nodes accordingly for your data.</para>

          <para>If possible, SAS drives for both Thor and Roxie as they almost
          equal to SATA drives now. If not for both, get SAS drives at least
          for your Roxie cluster.</para>

          <para>Thor replicates data and is typically configured for two
          copies.</para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>High Data Roxie sizing considerations</title>

          <para>Roxie keeps most of its data in memory, so you should allocate
          plenty of memory for Roxie. Calculate the approximate size of your
          data, and allocate appropriately. You should either increase the
          number of nodes, or increase the amount of memory.</para>

          <para>A good practice is to allocate a Dali for every Roxie
          cluster.</para>

          <para>Roxie should have a mirror. This is useful, when you need to
          update data. You update the mirror then make that primary and bring
          the other one down. This is a good practice but not really a
          necessity except in the case of high availability.</para>
