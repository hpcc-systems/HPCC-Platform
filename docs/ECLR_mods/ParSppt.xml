  <para>Natural Language Parsing<indexterm>
      <primary>Natural Language Parsing</primary>
    </indexterm> is accomplished in ECL by combining pattern definitions with
  an output RECORD structure (or TRANSFORM function) specifically designed to
  receive the parsed values, then using the PARSE function to perform the
  operation.</para>

  <para>Pattern definitions are used to detect "interesting" text within the
  data. Just as with all other attribute definitions, these patterns typically
  define specific parsing elements and may be combined to form more complex
  patterns, tokens, and rules.</para>

  <para>The output RECORD structure (or TRANSFORM function) defines the format
  of the resulting recordset. It typically contains specific pattern matching
  functions that return the "interesting" text, its length or position.</para>

  <para>The PARSE function implements the parsing operation. It returns a
  recordset that may then be post-processed as needed using standard ECL
  syntax, or simply output.</para>
