    </indexterm>The auth_feature attribute (valid only for an ESPService or
  ESPMethod) allows you to specify a means to verify a user's permission to
  execute a method.</para>

  <para>In order to enable this feature, your system must be configured to use
  a form of security that supports feature level authentication, such as LDAP
  security included in the Community edition of the platform. Once LDAP is
  configured, you would add the tag name provided as the value for the
  <emphasis role="bold">authFeature</emphasis> attribute to the feature level
  authentication list in the Security section of ECL Watch. Then you would set
  permissions for users and/or groups.</para>

  <para>If you are using a third-party Security Manager plugin, consult their
  documentation for details on adding the tag name to their security
  configuration.</para>

  <para>The auth_feature attribute is required for every method, but can be
  specified at the ESPService level to apply to all methods within a service.
  You can override for an individual method by setting the attribute at a
  method level.</para>

  <para>Setting auth_feature("NONE") means no authentication is needed.
  Setting auth_feature("DEFERRED") defers the authentication to the business
  logic in the ESP developer's method implementation logic.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Example:</emphasis></para>

  <programlisting> ESPservice MyService [auth_feature("NONE")]
 {
   ESPmethod MyMethod1(MyMethod1Request, MyMethod1Response);
   ESPmethod 
    [
     description("MyMethod Two"),
     auth_feature("AllowMyMethod2"),
     help("This method does everything MyMethod1 does plus a few extra features"),
     min_ver("1.2")
    ]
   MyMethod2(MyMethod2Request, MyMethod2Response);
 };</programlisting>
