    <title>ESDL Attributes</title>

    <para>You can use ESDL attributes to extend and override the default
    behavior of an ESDL definition. For example, adding a max_len(n) to a
    string defines the string will only need to store a certain number of
    characters.</para>

    <para>Many attributes are treated as hints that may have more effect on
    some implementations than others. For example, max_len(n) will affect
    generated ECL code, but is ignored when generating C++.</para>
