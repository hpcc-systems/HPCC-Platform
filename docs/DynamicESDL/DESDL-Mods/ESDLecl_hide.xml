  <title><emphasis role="bold">ecl_hide</emphasis></title>

  <para>The <emphasis>ecl_hide</emphasis> attribute hides the field from ECL
  (that is, the field is removed when generating the ECL code). This is used
  for some special cases.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Example:</emphasis></para>

  <programlisting>ESPstruct Relative
 {
    [ecl_hide] ESParray&lt;ESPstruct Relative, Relative&gt; Relatives;
    "
 };   </programlisting>

  <para>In this case, the Relative structure is defined in a recursive manner,
  and ECL does not support such a construct. Therefore, we use
  <emphasis>ecl_hide</emphasis> to avoid the recursive definition in
  ECL.</para>

  <para>Sometimes a field is hidden from ECL for other reasons. In these
  cases, <emphasis>ecl_hide</emphasis> is not needed.</para>
