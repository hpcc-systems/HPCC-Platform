      <title>counter and count_val</title>

      <para>These two attributes are used to help ESP calculate the record
      count of the response.</para>

      <para><emphasis>counter</emphasis> counts the number of children of the
      nodes. When the node is an array, it is the same as the number of items
      in the array.</para>

      <para><emphasis>count_val</emphasis> will use the value of the node as
      record count. Field <emphasis role="bold">RecordCount</emphasis> is
      implicitly marked as <emphasis>count_val</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>When an response has multiple counter, count_val, the sum of the
      values is returned as record-count.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Example:</emphasis></para>
