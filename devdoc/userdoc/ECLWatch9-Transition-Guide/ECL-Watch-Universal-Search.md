# ECL Watch Universal Search

At the top of the page, there is a global search facility allowing you to search for anything within the ECL Watch interface. This is similar to the global search in previous versions, but includes a number of usability improvements.

You can search for any of the following:

- Workunit ID (WUID)
- User
- File
- DFU workunit
- Query
- or even ECL code within a workunit

The results are sorted by type and each result is clickable, allowing you to drill down for more details. The first tab shows **All results**. Other tabs each show only one type based on your search criteria, such as **ECL Workunit**, **DFU Workunit**, **Logical File**, and **Query**.
