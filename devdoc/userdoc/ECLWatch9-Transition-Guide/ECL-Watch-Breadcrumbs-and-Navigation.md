# ECL Watch Breadcrumbs and Navigation

ECL Watch now uses standard Web page URLs and each time you drill down into a section (such as Workunit details) a series of **breadcrumbs** are displayed. This allows you to navigate easily to any place along the trail. You can also use the Forward and Back buttons on your browser and copy the URL of any displayed page from the browser’s address bar to send to a colleague via email or text message.
