# ECL Watch Technical Preview Feature

This feature displays a new visual interface for ECL Watch. The Tech Preview first began in HPCC Systems version 8.6.0 and will now be the default setting when ECL Watch is opened. This setting is “sticky,” in other words, it remembers the last setting used the next time you access it with a browser.

To revert back to the legacy view, you can access the switch via the following menu:

**Note:** We encourage you to use the new version as much as possible and provide feedback using our [Community Issue Tracker](https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/jira/).
