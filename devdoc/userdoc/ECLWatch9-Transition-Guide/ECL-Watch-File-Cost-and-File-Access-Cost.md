# ECL Watch File Cost and File Access Cost

ECL Watch now allows you to monitor the cost of running your jobs in the cloud environment. Please read this blog on [Cloud Cost Savings using ECL Watch](https://hpccsystems.com/resources/cloud-cost-savings-using-ecl-watch/) written by Senior Software Engineer, Shamser Ahmed.

Two new columns have been added to the Workunit’s table in ECL Watch to show the cost values related to workunits, which may be sorted by either cost column to find the most expensive jobs.
