# ECL Watch 9.0 Transition Guide

This guide is designed to help you manage the user's transition from using ECL Watch versions prior to Version 9.0.x to the newest HPCC Systems version. There is a technical preview switch in versions 8.4.20 and newer, but we recommend using HPCC Systems 9.0 or later for testing and evaluation purposes. Please use the following links to navigate the different items in the update.

There is a blog [available here](https://hpccsystems.com/resources/nifty-features-in-ecl-watch-version-9-0/) to walk you through these steps as well as a [short video here](https://youtu.be/NDj0LeetsPU) highlighting these updates.
