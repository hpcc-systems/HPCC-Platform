# HPCC Systems Build Workflows

# Overview 
This document outlines the Build Workflows of the HPCC Platform. These workflows are executed using GitHub Actions. Specifically, these workflows are facilitated through the build-assets.yml and build-vcpkg.yml algorithim.Both of these YAML files are apllicable for both enterprise and commmunity builds of the HPCC Platform.

# Platforms which the build processes support: 
- Ubuntu 20.04-24.04
- CentOS 7
- RockyLinux 8
- Windows 2019/2022
- macOS 13/14
- wasm32-emscripten

# Purpose
Build-vcpkg: 
- Validate code changes in pull requests, ensuring new contributions do not break existing functions of the HPCC Platform/main codebase.
- Ensuring the HPCC Platform can compile and perform on a variety of different operating systems's/architecures.
- A main part of this is due to running a test suite(a series of tests for the HPCC-Platform).

Build-assets:
- To automate the release process when a version tag is pushed to the Github
- This release process is a set of actions where the HPCC platform is compiled through production configurations based on the OS.
- Bundle the compiled file into installable packages.
- Then publish these artifacts based on the specific image type.
- And finally notify the user and systems for this release.

# Steps
How the workflow proceeds depending on the trigger type:
# 1.Trigger Event/Workflow
   Both files run on:
   - Pull Requests.
   - Tagged releases.
   - input from user.
# 2. Execution
- Compiles the HPCC Platform across the different Operating Systems supported.
# 3. Tests run
  - This tests are important to ensure that the HPCC platform is behaving as expxected and no new pull request have disrupted its functions
  - This done through a rigorous test suite including smoke ,UI ,regression, and bundle tests. 
# 4. Generate and Upload Artifiacts
- Package the compiled file into the binarie,Docker format, etc
- In the build-assets.yml workflow, a build Docker action is executed concurrently for each supported operating system (please see supported platforms below for a comprehensive list of all supported operating systems). Separate versions are constructed for community and internal/enterprise versions. Variables are computed and stored, followed by the build-assets workflow invoking the build-vcpkg workflow which assembles the Docker image and verifies if its production was successful. 
- Publish this artifact to the known users/systems.
