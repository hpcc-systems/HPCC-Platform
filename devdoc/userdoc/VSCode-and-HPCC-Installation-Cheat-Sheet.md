# VS Code and HPCC Systems Installation Cheat Sheet

You can use Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE for HPCC Systems.  VS Code is a cross-platform IDE that uses extensions to extend its functionality.  We have created an [ECL language extension](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/vscode-ecl) that allows VS Code to syntax check ECL code and submit it to an HPCC Systems cluster, using client tools created for our supported operating systems.  Below is a cheat sheet outlining the steps for installing VS Code, the client tools, and the VS Code ECL language extension. For further details, including the setup of the VS Code ECL extension, refer to this [blog](https://hpccsystems.com/resources/switching-from-the-ecl-ide-to-the-vs-code-with-the-ecl-language-extension/) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7DAZvZ2kp4).
