## Sunsetting of the 32-bit Client Tools

As of version 9.6.0, the 32-bit version of the HPCC Client Tools will no longer be actively developed, supported, or distributed.

By focusing our resources on the 64-bit version, we can ensure continued innovation and improved security. This helps us provide the best possible experience for our users.
