# HPCC Writing Style Guide

This section covers the best practice information for writing and
contributing to the HPCC Systems® Platform documentation.

## General 

We strive to maintain a consistent voice. These guidelines can help your
writing match that voice.

-   **Use present tense, active voice**. Documentation should be you
    speaking directly to the reader. Simply tell them what to do.

    This example sentence: "The user selects the file menu." is passive
    voice. You wouldn’t say it that way in a conversation.

    You should use active voice wording, such as: "Select the file
    menu".

    Similarly, instructions like these are active voice: "Press the
    button" or "Submit the file".

    Documentation is you instructing the user. Just tell them what to
    do.

-   **Be Brief and keep it simple.** Be efficient with your words. Keep
    sentences short and concise. Keep paragraphs short as well. Use just
    a few sentences per paragraph. Use simple words wherever possible
    and try to avoid lengthy explanations.

-   **Consistency:** Be consistent. Use the same voice across all
    documents. Use the same term, use the same spelling, punctuation,
    etc. Follow the conventions in this guide.

-   When writing formal documentation that is more than a new feature
    announcement, do not refer to a new feature, or coming features as
    such, this does not hold up well over time.

    Do not refer to how things were done in the past. For example, "in
    the past we had to do X-Y-Z steps and now we no longer have to. This
    ‘new feature’ can do it in one step, Z". This only adds potential
    confusion. Just instruct on exactly what needs to be done now, using
    words efficiently as possible, so for this example just say “perform
    step Z”

## Terms 

There are many terms specific to HPCC Systems® and the HPCC Systems
platform. Use the following style guide for word usage and
capitalization guidelines to use when referring to system components or
other HPCC-specific entities. Maintain consistent usage throughout all
docs.

### HPCC Systems® 

Officially and legally the organizaion's name is HPCC Systems® and it is a
registered trademark.

You should always refer to the platform as the HPCC Systems® platform and the
registration mark ® should appear in the first and most prominent
mention of the name.

While it is acceptable to use the ® anywhere in a document, it is
required to be used in the first and most prominent mention - so the
average reader will be aware. Any usage after that first and most
prominent is optional.

### Word Choices 

#### Write up vs Write-up 

Hyphenated when used as a noun. No Hyphen when used as a verb phrase.

Examples:

-   Did you read the write-up?

-   Would you write up the steps to reproduce?

#### Assure vs ensure vs insure 

To “assure” a person of something is to make him or her confident of it.

According to the Associated Press style, to “ensure” that something
happens is to make certain that it does, and to “insure” is to issue an
insurance policy.

Other authorities, however, consider “ensure” and “insure”
interchangeable. We prefer ensure when it is not talking about
insurance.
