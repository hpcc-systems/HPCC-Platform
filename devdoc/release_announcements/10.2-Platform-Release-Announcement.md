### Roxie Runtime and I/O Optimizations

- [HPCC-35022 CRoxieFileCache::lookupFile should allow concurrent lookups](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20425) — Reduces the time Roxie takes to start up when the `parallelQueryLoadThreads` or `numResolveFilenameThreads` options are used.
- [HPCC-34955 Support using io_uring for tcp reads in roxie](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20484) — Adds the capability for Roxie to use TCP as the network transport layer through the `transportProtocol` option.
- [HPCC-35550 Remove Roxie code to model differences in compression speed](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20784) — Simplifies compression handling to reduce overhead and improve consistency.

### Storage and Indexing

- [HPCC-35242 Allow indexes to be loaded in parallel](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20572) — Parallel index loading significantly reduces startup and recovery times.
- [HPCC-34619 Disk Page Cache](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20351) — When Roxie is reading data from remote storage, this adds an option to cache frequent reads on local SSD/NVMe, improving performance.
- [HPCC-35626 Default save dali store in binary format](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20827) — Uses binary format for Dali store by default for improved load/save performance.
- [HPCC-35296 Improve AWS S3 implementation](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20699) — Improvements to AWS SDK integration, thread safety, error handling, and performance optimizations including read-ahead buffering and multipart upload support for large files.

### Data Ingestion and Heap Tuning

- [HPCC-35359 Enable new quoted csv partitioner in 10.0.x by default](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20693) — Significantly reduces the time to partition large CSV files that use quoted fields.
- [HPCC-35285 Introduce a RHFlimitedcount heap option to reduce contention](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/20657) — Adds heap configuration to reduce contention under high-concurrency workloads.

## Notable Changes and Features
