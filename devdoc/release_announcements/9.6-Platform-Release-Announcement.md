# HPCC : 9.6 Platform Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the next generation of the HPCC Systems® Platform. This exciting new release, version 9.6.0, takes everything you loved about the platform and elevates it to a new level.

## Highlights

- **Enhanced Functionality for the Cloud**
  The primary focus of development is Cloud support. We have made 9.6 more robust for Cloud deployments. This includes:
  - Support for Auxiliary Queues for Thor clusters in Helm charts ([HPCC-31248](https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/browse/HPCC-31248))
  - Support for a plane parameter in some Standard Library methods ([HPCC-31212](https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/browse/HPCC-31212) & [HPCC-31213](https://hpccsystems.atlassian.net/browse/HPCC-31213))
  - A Helm chart for a managed minimal Grafana Loki Stack instance for component log processing. ([Readme.md](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/tree/master/helm/managed/logging/loki-stack#readme))

- **Improved Performance**
  Numerous "under the covers" improvements to increase performance.

- **Tighter Security**
  Many improvements made in the area of security.

- **Enhanced User Experience**
  Improvements to the ECL Watch interface designed to improve productivity and provide a more intuitive workflow.

- **Open Telemetry Support**
  We have integrated Open Telemetry's SDK and tools into our codebase and created a framework (JTrace) for instrumenting HPCC components.
  We've implemented initial instrumentation of some components and added ECL support for tracing/spans.
