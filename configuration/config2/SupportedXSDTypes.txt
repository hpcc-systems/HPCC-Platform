The following xsd types are supported

Base: String
Derived: -
Restrictions: enumeration, length, maxLength, minLength, pattern, whiteSpace(collapse)


Base: integer
Drived: negativeInteger, nonNegativeInteger, positiveInteger, nonPositiveInteger 
Restrictions: enumeration, maxInclusive, maxExclusive, minInclusive, minExclusive


Layout limitations:

Includes locations are restricted a bit.

Includes are parsed and processed differently based on their location.

complexType - no attributes are supported (essentially only required for XSD compliance)

Environment XSD is processed at the top level, it icnludes component XSDs and others?
- The 1st level element tags under Environment may include a component XSD, otherwise it must fully 
  define the component (not a component may still have an include if needed).

Includes are used by config2 to define things and are not "inserted" into the schema and therefore cannot be used 
to extend a schema. That must be done using things like attribute groups which can be defined in an include that is 
in a legal location

For a component, Only these top level elements are supported
- xs:include <- done first in order to pick up any types 
- xs:attributeGroup MUST have schema as parent, otherwise ignored

don't support attribute w/schema as parent?


XSD file format:

Includes
then element for a component
