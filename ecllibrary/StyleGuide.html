<H1>ECL standard library style guide</H1>

The ECL code in the standard library should follow the following style guidelines:
<ul>
<li>All ECL keywords in upper case</li>
<li>ECL reserved types in upper case</li>
<li>Public attributes in camel case with leading upper case</li>
<li>Private attributes in lower case with underscore as a separator</li>
<li>Field names in lower case with underscore as a separator</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Standard indent is 2 spaces (no tabs)</li>
<li>Maximum line length of 120 characters</li>
<li>Compound statements have contents indented, and END is aligned with the opening statement</li>
<li>Field names are not indented to make them line up within a record structure</li>
<li>Parameters are indented as necessary</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Use javadoc style comments on all functions/attributes (see <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/">Writing Javadoc Comments</A>)</li>
</ul>

For example:

<pre>

my_record := RECORD
  INTEGER4 id;
  STRING firstname{MAXLENGTH(40)};
  STRING lastname{MAXLENGTH(50)};
END;

/**
  * Returns a dataset of people to treat with caution matching a particular lastname.  The
  * names are maintained in a global database of undesirables.
  *
  * @param  search_lastname    A lastname used as a filter
  * @return                    The list of people
  * @see                       NoFlyList
  * @see                       MorePeopleToAvoid
  */

EXPORT DodgyCharacters(STRING search_lastname) := FUNCTION
  raw_ds := DATASET(my_record, 'undesirables', THOR);
  RETURN raw_ds(last_name = search_lastname);
END;

</pre>

Some additional rules for attributes in the library:
<ul>
<li>Services should be SHARED and EXPORTed via intermediate attributes</li>
<li>All attributes must have at least one matching test.  If you're not on the test list you're not coming in.</li>
</ul>

</body>
