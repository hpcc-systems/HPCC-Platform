    <para>
        The esp/clients/wsdfuaccess directory contains the sources for the esp/clients/wsdfuaccess library.
       
        The library provides SOAP access to the ESP DFUFileAccess service.
        The service can be called with a logical filename, access rights and various other flags
        (see ESPrequest DFUFileAccessRequest), to retreive file meta data with a security token that can
        be used to access physical files on dafilesrv.
