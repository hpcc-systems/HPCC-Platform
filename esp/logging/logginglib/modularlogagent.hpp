/**
 * The modular log agent framework defines an implementation of IEspLogAgent that delegates agent
 * requests to helper classes. This delegation enables a single agent plugin to support multiple
 * logging requirements by configuring which helpers are to be used by any single agent created
 * by the plugin.
 *
 * The framework includes at least one implementation of each type of helper. Plugins are not
 * required to use these implementations, nor are they required to reference them with "standard"
 * configuration keys. Consider that a plugin implementing a user's business logic may want its
 * default behavior to use the business logic in place of a default assigned by the platform.
 * Each plugin is encouraged to provide documentation of its exposed functionality.
 *
 * The "modularlogagent" platform plugin includes README.md, which describes the configuration of
 * multiple elements used by the agent. The properties of each element may vary from plugin to
 * plugin, but the elements are defined by the framework.
 *
 * Refer to interface and implementation declarations for additional details regarding available
 * modules. Refer to each plugin to know which modules are registered and how they may be accessed.

     * Log content filters are always applied, but are not required. The application of filters,

     * terminology that is inconsistent with custom ESDL transform terminology for the same concepts
