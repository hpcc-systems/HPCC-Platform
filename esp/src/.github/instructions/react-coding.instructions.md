# Project coding standards for TypeScript and React

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code and avoid `any` types; leverage strict typing and generics.
- Prefer functional programming principles (pure functions, no side effects, immutability).
- Use interfaces and type aliases for data structures and props.
- Prefer immutable data (`const`, `readonly`, spread operators for updates).
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safe property access.
- Organize types and interfaces in dedicated files for reusability.
- Use type-safe utility libraries when possible.

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks (avoid class components).
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional or nested hooks).
- Use `React.FunctionComponent` type for components with children, and define prop types explicitly.
- Prefer `useStyles` over inline styles for consistency and performance.
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable; follow single-responsibility principle.
- Use CSS modules or CSS-in-JS for component-level styling; avoid global styles.
- Use `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `React.memo` for performance optimization.
- Prefer controlled components for forms; use libraries like `formik` or `react-hook-form` for complex forms.
- Use context and custom hooks for shared state and logic.
- Write unit tests for all components and hooks (e.g., with Jest, React Testing Library).
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML).

## Key Frameworks and Libraries

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Core UI library for building components.
