/**
 * This is the default application build profile used by the boilerplate. While it looks similar, this build profile
 * is different from the package build profile at `app/package.js` in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. you can have multiple application build profiles (e.g. one for desktop, one for tablet, etc.), but only one
 *    package build profile;
 * 2. the package build profile only configures the `resourceTags` for the files in the package, whereas the
 *    application build profile tells the build system how to build the entire application.
 *
 * Look to `util/build/buildControlDefault.js` for more information on available options and their default values.
