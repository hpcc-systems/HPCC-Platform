    <title>rtl/eclrtl</title>

    <para>
        The rtl/eclrtl directory contains the sources for the eclrtl.so library.
    </para>
    <para>
        The eclrtl library is primarily the runtime support library for the code generator.  Many of the functions it contains
        are related to processing the different datatypes (e.g., string/int/unicode/datasets/dictionaries).  It also contains
        the functions for regular expressions.
    </para>
    <para>
        Eclrtl should only contain code that is needed by the code generator - it is not a library for sharing code between the engines.
        In particular it should not have any activity related code (that should go in thorhelper).  All the functions assume that
        the roxiemem memory manager is being used for allocating rows.  This library also shouldn't contain any dependence on dali.
    </para>
    <para>
        The library is also used by many other libraries in the system primarily for the functions for the system functions and the
        functions for converting between different datatypes.
    </para>
    <para>
        One of its goals is to isolate the generated code from other parts of the system and minimize the dependencies.  There
        are two reasons for this -

                It allows compiled workunits to remain compatible with future revisions of the platform.  This allows the
                platform to be upgraded withut having to recompile any deployed queries.

            <listitem>
                It reduces the include file dependencies for the generated code.  In particular the header files should
                not include jlib, icu, boost or any other complex set of includes.  It is fine for the implementation to use those libraries,
                but there should be no direct references in the headers.  This reduces the dependencies required on a system
                and also reduces the compile time.
