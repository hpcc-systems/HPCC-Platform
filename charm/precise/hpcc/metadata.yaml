  HPCC Systems, an open source High Performance Computing Cluster, is a massive parallel-processing computing 
  platform that solves Big Data problems. HPCC Systems is an enterprise-proven platform for manipulating, 
  transforming, querying, and data warehousing Big Data. Built by LexisNexis, the HPCC platform has helped 
  it grow to a $1.5 billion information solutions company.
  .
  The HPCC Systems architecture incorporates a data query engine (called Thor) and a data delivery engine 
  (called Roxie), as well as support components. An HPCC environment can include only Thor clusters, 
  or both Thor and Roxie clusters. The HPCC Juju charm creates a cluster which contains both, but you can 
  customize it after deployment.

  The HPCC Juju Charm encapsulates best practice configurations for the HPCC Systems Platform. You can use a Juju Charm to stand up an HPCC Platform on:
