ECL Bundle writer's guide
=========================

************
Introduction

Purpose
=======
An ECL Bundle is a self-contained (other than dependencies on other bundles - see below) set of
ECL files, designed to be zipped up and distributed, downloaded, retrieved from online repositories,
and so on.

Structure
=========

An ECL bundle consists of a directory of ECL files, including the file Bundle.ecl which
contains the meta-data about the bundle. For really simple bundles, it is possible to store the
entire bundle in a single .ecl file, with Bundle exported from it as a nested module. Care is needed
in such cases that the Bundle module can be exported without any external dependencies (for example,
by using ,FORWARD on the main module's definition).

You must add the bundle folder as the source folder to have the same import paths for the attribute when 
installed as a bundle.

Metadata
========
The Bundle.ECL should inherit from the standard library module Std.BundleBase, as in the following
example::

  EXPORT Bundle := MODULE(Std.BundleBase)
    EXPORT Name := 'Bloom';
    EXPORT Description := 'Bloom filter implementation, and example of ECL bundle layout';
    EXPORT Authors := ['Richard Chapman','Charles Kaminski'];
    EXPORT License := 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0';
    EXPORT Copyright := 'Copyright (C) 2013 HPCC SystemsÂ®';
    EXPORT DependsOn := [];
    EXPORT Version := '1.0.0';
    EXPORT PlatformVersion := '4.0.0';
  END;

The meanings of the various fields in the metadata are described in Std.BundleBase.

Dependencies
============

A bundle can specify dependencies on zero or more other modules, using the DependsOn string set.
After the name of the bundle, a version or version range can be specified to indicate that a particular
version of the bundle is required.

Installing a bundle
===================
To install a bundle to your development machine, use the ecl command line tool: 

   ecl bundle install <bundlefile>.ecl
