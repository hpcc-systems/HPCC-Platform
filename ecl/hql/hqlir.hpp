/*
 * This header declares the Intermediate Representation (IR)
 * for ECL graphs (Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAG), for debug
 * dumps, test checks and optimisation analysis.
 *
 * It needs to be included from a top-level header, to make sure
 * it'll be available throughout the compiler code, but it's best
 * to keep it inside _DEBUG areas, since it's where it'll be used
 * most.
 *
 * The IR is meant to be a simple, non-redundant and complete
 * description of ECL graphs. The aim is to produce a textual
 * description of the DAG in a way that is easy to read it again
 * and produce correct graphs from it.
 *
 * When things get more complicated, and the IR gets used for
 * internal processes, it might be good to expose some simple
 * interfaces for importing/exporting expressions to IR.
 *
 * See the C++ file for better description of the IR.
