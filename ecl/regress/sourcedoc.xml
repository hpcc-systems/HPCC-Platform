    <para>
        The ecl/regress directory contains the sources for the compiler regression suite.  This regression suite is used to
        check any changes to the eclcc compiler.  The recommended approach is
    </para>

    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
Run the regression suite and save the generated output.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
Make the changes to the source code.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
Re run the regression suite, compare the generated code, and check that all the changes are expected.
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>


    <para>
        The regression suite should contain at least one example of any language feature that is added to the system.
    </para>
    <para>
        To run the regression suite under windows:
    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
Ensure path to eclcc is set up correctly
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
Copy setreg.bat.sample to setreg.bat and modify the contents to reflect your set up.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
Copy rcompare.bat.sample to rcompare.bat and update to reflect your comparison program.
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

        r1.bat.sample can be used to run the regression test for a single file, e.g.,
        <programlisting>
        r1 dataset.ecl
</programlisting>
To run the full regression test use rall.bat, e.g.,
 <programlisting>
        rall
</programlisting>
    </para>
