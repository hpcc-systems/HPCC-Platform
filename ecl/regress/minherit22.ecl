//Current problems:
//1) Bound parameter will be concrete not abstract
//2) Cloning and overriding would need to be handled in bind phase (ok if common functions extracted)
//3) Would need a no_param(x, concreteAtom) also bound when a param is bound (or possible concrete(param)), so that uses could be distringuished
