Building the Rembed plugin
--------------------------

Building the plugin to embed R in ECL code is not enabled by default - this is
because it depends on a component (RInside) that can't be installed via standard
package-management utilities on most distros.

To install the prerequisites for building R support, use the following (Ubuntu 12.04)
or the equivalent for your distro.

sudo apt-get install r-base r-cran-rcpp
wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/RInside_0.2.10.tar.gz
sudo R CMD INSTALL RInside_0.2.10.tar.gz

Then you can enable building the Rembed plugin using

cmake <path_to_source> -DMAKE_REMBED=1
