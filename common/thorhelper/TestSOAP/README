Test SOAP server
----------------

This provides a service called TestService with methods called
greeting and espsplit.

You will need the following.
(1) A webserver, with CGI enabled.
(2) The perl modules Cwd, Config::Simple, and SOAP::Transort::HTTP.
(3) The scripts soaplog.cgi and soapdispatch.cgi, copied or symlinked
    into a location where they can be accessed via the webserver with
    CGI enable, with the correct permissions.
(4) The directory TestSOAP containing the module TestService.pm, both
    visible to the webserver.
(5) A config file soapserver.ini, in the directory where the CGI
    scripts are run, with values for logfile and libpath, and
    optionally a value for maxsleep (in seconds, to force a delay in
    the response).

For example:
 - I have apache running, with CGI enabled on /home/pete/public_html/cgi-bin.
 - I have TestSOAP in /home/pete.
 - I have symlinks in cgi-bin for soaplog.cgi and soapdispatch.cgi to
the copies in TestSOAP (and have enabled symlinks on the directory in
apache).
 - My /home/pete/public_html/cgi-bin/soapserver.ini reads as below.

logfile=/tmp/soap.log
libpath=/home/pete

If you run soaplog.cgi or soapdispatch.cgi from the command line, you
should see "Expected POST request, received NONE". If you point a web
browser at it, you should see "Expected POST request, received GET".

Test SOAP client
----------------

This tests the greeting method.

You will need the following.
(1) The test SOAP server working.
(2) The script soapclient, with the correct permissions.
(3) A config file soapclient.ini, in the current directory, with
    values for proxypath and myname.

For example, my soapclient.ini reads as below.

proxypath=http://127.0.0.1/~pete/cgi-bin/
myname=pete

If you run './soapclient log', you should see the message "SOAP
returned OK". The log file shows the request time, the the CGI
environment, the current directory, and the request content read from
standard input.

If you run './soapclient dispatch', you should see the same message,
followed by the response from the SOAP server, which should be a
single variable called 'saluation' with value e.g. 'hello pete'. The
log file shows the request time, the CGI environment, the current
directory, the message "Dispatching", the response status, the
response content, and the message "OK".

Testing with ECL for client
---------------------------

The basic query is contained in soapcall.ecl. You will need to edit it
to set proxypath and myname (values as in soapclient.ecl, above) and
proxyname (to 'log', to get the full request logged but not actually
dispatch it and so get no response; or 'dispatch' to actually dispatch
the request and hopefully get a response like 'hello pete'). For
example, I run the server on a machine named 'aphex', and my query
starts as below.

proxypath := 'http://aphex/~pete/cgi-bin/';
myname := 'pete';
proxyname := 'dispatch';

You will also need to uncomment whichever call(s) you want to test.
The greeting call should return e.g. "hello pete". The espsplit call
should return five rows: "hello", "world", "cat", "dog", and "pig".

N.B. The test server can't currently handle ESP-type calls with
MERGE(n). This is because that makes thorsoapcall send fooRequestArray
and expect fooResponseArray, a combination which is not compatible
with perl's SOAP::Lite.
