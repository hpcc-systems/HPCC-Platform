# Generic Writing Interfaces for HPCC Platform

## Overview

This document describes the interfaces created and modified to support generic writing functionality in the HPCC Platform. The design follows the established pattern from generic reading (`thorread.hpp`) to provide a consistent, extensible architecture for writing data in multiple formats.

## File Modified

- **`common/thorhelper/thorwrite.hpp`** - Enhanced with new interfaces and utility functions
- **`common/thorhelper/thorwrite.cpp`** - Implementation classes with resolved compilation issues

## Interface Changes

### 1. Enhanced Includes and Forward Declarations

```cpp
#include "jstatcodes.h"        // Added for StatisticKind enum
#include "thorcommon.hpp"      // Added for ILogicalRowWriter definition
```

**Note:** The original forward declaration approach for `ILogicalRowWriter` caused compilation issues due to incomplete type usage in the adapter interface. This was resolved by including the complete header definition.

### 2. Enhanced IDiskRowWriter Interface

**Added Methods:**
- `virtual offset_t getPosition() = 0;`
- `virtual unsigned __int64 getStatistic(StatisticKind kind) = 0;`

**Purpose:** These methods provide statistics and position tracking capabilities, matching the functionality available in the generic reading interfaces.

### 3. New IDiskRowWriterAdapter Interface

```cpp
interface IDiskRowWriterAdapter : extends ILogicalRowWriter
{
public:
    virtual bool setOutputFile(IFile * file, offset_t pos, size32_t recordSize, bool extend) = 0;
    virtual bool setOutputFile(const char * filename, offset_t pos, size32_t recordSize, bool extend) = 0;
    virtual bool setOutputFile(const RemoteFilename & filename, offset_t pos, size32_t recordSize, bool extend) = 0;
};
```

**Purpose:** This adapter interface bridges the new generic `IDiskRowWriter` interface with the existing `ILogicalRowWriter` interface used throughout the hthor infrastructure. This enables backward compatibility while allowing the use of generic writers.

**Factory Function:**
```cpp
extern THORHELPER_API IDiskRowWriterAdapter * createDiskRowWriterAdapter(IDiskRowWriter * diskWriter);
```

### 4. New IProviderRowWriter Interface

```cpp
interface IProviderRowWriter : extends IInterface
{
public:
    virtual void write(const void *row) = 0;
    virtual void flush() = 0;
    virtual void close() = 0;
};
```

**Purpose:** This interface is designed for future extensibility to support external data providers. It provides a foundation for pluggable third-party writing modules.

## Design Principles

### 1. Consistency with Generic Reading
The interfaces follow the same patterns established in `thorread.hpp`:
- Similar naming conventions
- Comparable method signatures
- Consistent factory function patterns
- Matching statistics and position tracking

### 2. Bridge Pattern Implementation
The `IDiskRowWriterAdapter` implements the bridge pattern to:
- Enable seamless integration with existing hthor code
- Avoid breaking changes to existing infrastructure
- Provide a clean abstraction layer

### 3. Extensibility and Modularity
- Support for multiple file formats through pluggable architecture
- Factory functions enable runtime format selection
- Provider interface supports future external integrations

### 4. Statistics and Monitoring
- Position tracking for debugging and progress monitoring
- Statistics collection compatible with existing platform metrics
- Support for various statistic kinds through `StatisticKind` enum

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Interface Definitions**: All core interfaces are defined and compile successfully
2. **Base Implementation Classes**: 
   - `DiskRowWriter` - Base class with statistics and position tracking
   - `LocalDiskRowWriter` - Local file writing implementation
   - `BinaryDiskRowWriter` - Flat/binary format writer (fully implemented)
3. **Adapter Pattern**: `IDiskRowWriterAdapter` bridge implementation ‚úÖ **Complete**
4. **Factory System**: Format registration and creation system

**Note:** Utility functions and format constants were removed from the current interface to keep it minimal and focused on core functionality.

### Resolved Compilation Issues

1. **Incomplete Type Error**: Fixed `ILogicalRowWriter` incomplete type issue by including proper headers
2. **Missing Virtual Functions**: Added required `getPosition()` and `getStatistic()` implementations to base classes
3. **Abstract Class Error**: Resolved by implementing all pure virtual methods in concrete classes
4. **Missing Adapter Implementation**: ‚úÖ **Added** `DiskRowWriterAdapter` class and `createDiskRowWriterAdapter()` factory function

### Current State

The generic writing system is now **functionally complete** with:
- ‚úÖ Core interfaces properly defined  
- ‚úÖ Base implementation classes working
- ‚úÖ Binary/flat format writer fully functional
- ‚úÖ Statistics and position tracking implemented
- ‚úÖ Factory and registration system in place
- ‚úÖ **Adapter implementation complete** - `DiskRowWriterAdapter` bridges generic writers to `ILogicalRowWriter`
- ‚úÖ **HThor integration implemented** - `CHThorDiskWriteActivity` now uses generic writers
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- üìù Utility functions removed (can be added later if needed)

### Adapter Implementation Details

**Class:** `DiskRowWriterAdapter` in `thorwrite.cpp`

The adapter implementation provides a clean bridge between the new generic writing interfaces and existing hthor infrastructure:

**Key Features:**
- Implements both `IDiskRowWriterAdapter` and `ILogicalRowWriter` interfaces
- Maintains a `Linked<IDiskRowWriter>` to the underlying generic writer
- Maps `writeRow()` calls to `diskWriter->write()`
- Maps `writeGroupedRow()` calls to `diskWriter->writeGrouped()`
- Forwards statistics and position queries directly to the disk writer
- Provides all three `setOutputFile()` overloads for different file types
- Uses `CInterfaceOf<>` for proper reference counting

**Factory Function:**
```cpp
IDiskRowWriterAdapter * createDiskRowWriterAdapter(IDiskRowWriter * diskWriter);
```

### HThor Integration

**File:** `ecl/hthor/hthor.cpp` and `ecl/hthor/hthor.ipp`

The generic writing infrastructure has been successfully integrated into the HThor engine:

1. **Class Enhancement**: Added `Owned<IDiskRowWriter> genericWriter` member to `CHThorDiskWriteActivity`
2. **Include Integration**: Added `#include "thorwrite.hpp"` to hthor.ipp
3. **Implementation**: Replaced `throwUnexpected()` in `CHThorDiskWriteActivity::open()` with working generic write logic
4. **Fallback Support**: If generic write fails, automatically falls back to format-specific writers for compatibility
5. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup through existing close() and destructor mechanisms

**Key Features:**
- Uses binary format as default (configurable in the future)
- Integrates with existing `formatOptions` and `providerOptions` members
- Maintains compatibility with existing hthor workflows
- Provides debug logging for troubleshooting
- Zero breaking changes to existing interfaces

### Current Limitations

**File Positioning Not Supported:**
- The `pos` parameter in `setOutputFile()` methods is **NOT currently supported**
- Attempting to use non-zero `pos` values will throw an exception with a clear error message
- Only writing from the beginning of files or in extend mode is supported

**Technical Reason:**
- Current implementation uses `ISerialOutputStream` which doesn't support seeking
- To support arbitrary positioning, the architecture needs to be modified to use `IFileIOStream`
- Alternative implementation example is provided in comments in `thorwrite.cpp`

**Extend Mode Limitations:**
- Extend mode positioning may not work correctly in all scenarios
- The implementation relies on file system behavior for append operations
- Proper extend mode support would require the same positioning architecture changes

**Workarounds:**
- Use `pos = 0` for writing from the beginning of files
- Use `extend = true` for appending to existing files (when supported by the file system)
- For precise positioning requirements, consider modifying the architecture as documented in the code comments

## Integration Points

### With Existing Code
- **hthor.cpp**: ‚úÖ **Implemented** - `CHThorDiskWriteActivity::open()` now uses generic writers via `IDiskRowWriterAdapter`
- **ILogicalRowWriter**: Existing code continues to work unchanged through adapter pattern
- **Statistics Framework**: Compatible with platform statistics collection
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to format-specific writers ensures compatibility

### HThor Integration Details
```cpp
// In CHThorDiskWriteActivity::open()
if (useGenericReadWrites) {
    // Create format mapping for binary format
    Owned<IRowWriteFormatMapping> mapping = createRowWriteFormatMapping(...);
    
    // Create generic writer
    genericWriter.setown(createDiskWriter("binary", false, mapping, providerOptions));
    
    // Set output file
    genericWriter->setOutputFile(file, 0, recordSize, extend);
    
    // Create adapter for ILogicalRowWriter compatibility
    Owned<IDiskRowWriterAdapter> adapter = createDiskRowWriterAdapter(genericWriter);
    writer = adapter.getClear();
}
```

### Future Implementation Classes
Additional format writers can be implemented by:
1. Inheriting from `LocalDiskRowWriter` or `DiskRowWriter`
2. Implementing format-specific `write()` and `writeGrouped()` methods
3. Overriding `matches()` for format identification
4. Properly tracking position and statistics in write operations
5. Registering with the format factory system

**Example formats ready for implementation:**
- CSV writer (skeleton exists, needs field serialization logic)
- XML writer
- JSON writer
- Parquet writer (with appropriate libraries)

## Usage Pattern

```cpp
// 1. Create format mapping
IRowWriteFormatMapping * mapping = createRowWriteFormatMapping(...);

// 2. Create generic disk writer
IDiskRowWriter * diskWriter = createDiskWriter(format, streamRemote, mapping, providerOptions);

// 3. Create adapter for compatibility
IDiskRowWriterAdapter * adapter = createDiskRowWriterAdapter(diskWriter);

// 4. Use as standard ILogicalRowWriter
ILogicalRowWriter * writer = adapter;
writer->putRow(row);
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Architecture**: Consistent approach to generic I/O operations
2. **Format Extensibility**: Easy to add new output formats
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in statistics and position tracking
