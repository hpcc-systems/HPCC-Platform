# Overrides for storage in hpcc, using host directories.
# NB: The "hpcc-localfile" helm charts should be installed 1st.
# The "hpcc-localfile" helm chart provisions and creates the
# PVC's required by HPCC mapped to directories on the host.
# The pvc names are dynamic based on the install name.
# In this example the install name was "localfile"

#The following is a generated values yaml that you can capture and feed to the hpcc helm chart when installing.
#it will configure the hpcc storage to use the planes and pvcs installed by this chart.
#e.g.:
#helm install myhpcc hpcc/hpcc --set global.image.version=latest --values values-localfile.yaml
