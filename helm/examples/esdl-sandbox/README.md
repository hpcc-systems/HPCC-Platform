Example of esdl-sandbox service.  This service is an alpha release.  It may change quite a bit before the final release.

After deploying a helm k8s hpcc..

From helm/examples/esdl-sandbox folder:

1. Generate ecl layouts:
esdl ecl esdl_example.esdl .

2. Publish example roxie query:
ecl publish roxie RoxieEchoPersonInfo.ecl

3. Publish the esdl defined service to dynamicESDL:
esdl publish esdl_example.esdl EsdlExample

4. Bind both java and roxie implementations to DynamicESDL (note that here, port is internal pod port not service port)
esdl bind-service esdl-sandbox 8880 esdlexample.1 EsdlExample --config esdl_binding.xml

5. Test calling the service:
soapplus -url http://.:8899/EsdlExample -i roxierequest.xml

6. Interact with both services by browsing to:

http://\<DynamicEsdlIP\>:8899
