# ESP Trace Flags

Each ESP process may specify its own set of flags for controlling trace behavior. The specific flags may be shared with other platform components, shared amongst ESPs, or unique to an ESP.

## Accepted Flags

Detailed description of flags used by any ESP.

### Shared Platform Flags

Flags defined in `system/jlib/jtrace.hpp` and used by multiple platform processes.

#### traceSecMgr

Control security manager trace output. The ESP enables or suppresses timing span creation based on this flag. Security managers which generate significant amounts of trace output are encouraged to observe this setting.

- true: record security manager-related trace output
- false, *omitted*: suppress security manager-related trace output

### Shared ESP Flags

Flags defined in `esp/platform/esptrace.h` and applicable to most, if not all, ESP configurations.

#### traceLevel

Set the defailt trace level in the process. Accepted values are:
- 1, traceStandard: most important output
- 2, traceDetailed: average verbosity output
- 3, traceMax: highest verbosity output
- default: use existing level
  - Release builds default to traceStandard
  - Debug builds default to traceMax
- 0, traceNone, *all other values*: no trace output

## Process Configuration

### Containerized

#### esp.yaml

Each ESP application's configuration object may embed one instance of a `traceFlags` object. Within this object, at most one property per [available flag]]#availableflags] is expected. Properties not described here are ignored.

For example, the `eclwatch` process might be configured to use detailed reporting like this:

```yml
esp:
- name: eclwatch
  traceFlags:
    traceLevel: 2
```

## Cluster Overrides

A values file may be used with the `helm install` command to override the settings of all ESPs. The `--set` option may be used to target the settings of a specific ESP in the configured array.

### Bare-Metal

No support for defining trace flags is provided by the `configmgr` application. Within a stand-alone `esp.xml` file, however, a `traceFlags` child of the `EspProcess` element may be defined.

The previous YAML example may be reproduced in XML with the following:

```xml
<EspProcess ...>
  <traceFlags traceLevel="2" />
  ...
<EspProcess>
```
