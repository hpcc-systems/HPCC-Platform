Activity is reported in terms of buckets. Buckets are groups of one or more
consecutive pages of an index file, where each page is a block of 8KB that
starts at an event reported ofsset. The default bucket size is one page and
provides the most detailed analysis, but may require too much memory for
large datasets and/or large index files. Consider increasing the bucket size
using the --granularity option to reduce memory consumption.

Buckets with no activity are excluded from analysis. The total number of
buckets per index file is unknown, as are the numbers of pages representing
leaf and branch index nodes. Without these numbers, the potential number of
inactive buckets for each node kind cannot be determined. Inclusion of inactive
buckets would skew the results.

Finding the Most Active Buckets:
---------------------------------

The default analysis reports the most active leaf and branch buckets for each
index file. The number of buckets reported, for each node kind, is controlled
by the --top option. The default is 10 buckets.

For each node kind of each index file, up to the N buckets with the greatest
event count are reported in descending order. In the event the first buckets
omitted from the report have the same count as the last bucket to be reported,
the quantity of buckets with that count is reported as the "dropped" bucket
value.

Statistics for each active bucket in each index file are also included. These
include the lowest event count, the average event count per active bucket, and
the highest event count.

Example:
> evtool index hotspot --load generated.evt --granularity=10 --top=2
analysis: top 2 buckets
event: IndexLoad
granularity: 10
file:
- id: 2147483651
  path: /home/tim/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/../community/var/lib/HPCCSystems/hpcc-data/roxie/regress/single/searchindex._1_of_1
  leaves:
    stats:
      buckets: 5
      total: 36
      min: 1
      avg: 7.2
      max: 26
    bucket:
    - first-node: 4096
      events: 26
    - first-node: 2048
      events: 4
    - dropped: 1
      events: 4
  branches:
    stats:
      buckets: 1
      total: 11
    bucket:
    - first-node: 6144
      events: 11

Identifying All Activity
------------------------

Setting --top to zero reports all active buckets, in order of bucket position,
for each index file. The index node kind contained by the bucket is reported
with each bucket, as one of 'L' (leaf), 'B' (branch), or 'L/B' (ambiguous, or
both leaf and branch). At most one bucket may be ambiguous, as only one bucket
may include the final leaf and initial branch pages.

Statistics for each active bucket in each index file are also included. These
include the lowest event count, the average event count per active bucket, and
the highest event count.

THe "//file/bucket" array may be used to generate a heat map of index activity.
Absent a total bucket count for each index file, the final dimension of a heat
map must be determined separately. Absent a total leaf bucket count, a heat map
cannot reliably differentiate leaf and branch inactivity, if such behavior is
desired.

Example:
> evtool index hotspot --load generated.evt --granularity=10 --top=0
analysis: all buckets
event: IndexLoad
granularity: 10
file:
- id: 2147483651
