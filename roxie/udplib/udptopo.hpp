/*
 * IBYTI handling
 *
 * IBYTI (I beat you to it) messages are sent by the slave that is going to process a particular request,
 * to tell the other slaves on the same channel not to bother.
 *
 * In order to reduce wasted work, for each request a "primary" subchannel is selected (based on a hash of the
 * packet's RUID) - this channel will process the request immediately, but others will delay a little while
 * in order to give the expected IBYTI time to arrive.
 *
 * The decision on how long to delay is a little complex - too long, and you end up losing the ability for a
 * backup slave to step in when primary is under load (or dead); too short and you end up duplicating work.
 * It's also important for the delay to be adaptive so that if a slave goes offline, the other slaves on the
 * subchannel don't keep waiting for it to take its turn.
 *
 * The adaptiveness is handled by noting any time that we delay waiting for an IBYTI that does not arrive - this
 * may mean that the slave(s) we expected to get there first are offline, and thus next time we don't wait quite
 * so long for them. Conversely, any time an IBYTI does arrive from another slave on your channel, you know that
 * it is online and so can reset the delay to its original value.
 *
 * A previous version of this code assumed a single missed IBYTI was enough to assume that a slave was dead and drop the
 * delay for that slave to zero - this turned out to behave pretty poorly when under load, with much duplicated work.
 * Thus we take care to adjust the delay more gradually, while still ending up with a zero delay if the buddy does not respond
 * several times in a row.
 */

/*
 * A "subchannel" is a value from 1 to 7 (with current settings) that indicates which "copy" of the data for this channel
 * is being processed by this slave. A value of 0 would indicate that this slave does not have any data for this channel.
 * In a typical 100-way roxie with cyclic redundancy, node 1 would be processing channel 1, subchannel 1, and channel 2,
 * subchannel 2, node 2 would be processing channel 2, subchannel 1 and channel 3, subchannel 2, and so on u to node 100,
 * which would process channel 100, subchannel 1 and channel 1, subchannel 2.
 *
 * To determine which subchannel is the "primary" for a given query packet, a hash value of fields from the packet header
 * is used, modulo the number of subchannels on this channel. The slave on this subchannel will respond immediately.
 * Slaves on other channels delay according to the subchannel number - so on a 4-way redundant system, if the primary
 * subchannel is decided to be 2, the slave on subchannel 3 will delay by 1 ibytiDelay value, the slave on subchannel 4 by
 * 2 values, and the slave on subchannel 1 by 3 values (this assumes all slaves are responding normally).
 *
 * In fact, the calculation is a little more complex, in that the "units" are adjusted per subchannel to take into account
 * the responsiveness or otherwise of a subchannel. Initially, the delay value for each subchannel is the same, but any time
 * a slave waits for an IBYTI that does not arrive on time, the delay value for any slave that is "more primary" than me for
 * this packet is reduced. Any time an IBYTI _does_ arrive on time, the delay is reset to its initial value.
