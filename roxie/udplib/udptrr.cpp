     * The ReceiveManager has several threads:
     * 1. receive_receive_flow (priority 3)
     *     - waits for packets on flow port
     *     - maintains list of nodes that have pending requests
     *     - sends ok_to_send to one sender at a time
     * 2. receive_sniffer (default priority 3, configurable)
     *     - waits for packets on sniffer port
     *     - updates information about what other node are currently up to
     *     - idea is to preferentially send "ok_to_send" to nodes that are not currently sending to someone else
     *     - doesn't run if no multicast
     *     - can I instead say "If I get a request to send and I'm sending to someone else, send a "later"?
     * 3. receive_data (priority 4)
     *     - reads data packets off data socket
     *     - runs at v. high priority
     *     - used to have an option to perform collation on this thread but a bad idea:
     *        - can block (ends up in memory manager via attachDataBuffer).
     *        - Does not apply back pressure
     *     - Just enqueues them. We don't give permission to send more than the queue can hold.
     * 4. PacketCollator (standard priority)
     *     - dequeues packets
     *     - collates packets

    /*
     * Handling lost packets
     *
     * We try to make lost packets unlikely by telling slaves when to send (and making sure they don't send unless
     * there's a good chance that socket buffer will have room). But we can't legislate for network issues.
     *
     * What packets can be lost?
     * 1. Data packets - handled via retrying the whole query (not ideal). But will also leave the inflight count wrong. We correct it any time
     *    the data socket times out but that may not be good enough.
     * 2. RequestToSend - the sender's resend thread checks periodically. There's a short initial timeout for getting a reply (either "request_received"
     *    or "okToSend"), then a longer timeout for actually sending.
     * 3. OkToSend - there is a timeout after which the permission is considered invalid (based on how long it SHOULD take to send them).
     *    The requestToSend retry mechanism would then make sure retried.
     *    MORE - if I don't get a response from OkToSend I should assume lost and requeue it.
     * 4. complete - covered by same timeout as okToSend. A lost complete will mean incoming data to that node stalls for the duration of this timeout,
     *    and will also leave inflight count out-of-whack.
     * 4. Sniffers - expire anyway
     *

/*
Thoughts on flow control / streaming:
1. The "continuation packet" mechanism does have some advantages
    - easy recovery from slave failures
    - slave recovers easily from Roxie server failures
    - flow control is simple (but is it effective?)

2. Abandoning continuation packet in favour of streaming would give us the following issues:
    - would need some flow control to stop getting ahead of a Roxie server that consumed slowly
        - flow control is non trivial if you want to avoid tying up a slave thread and want slave to be able to recover from Roxie server failure
    - Need to work out how to do GSS - the nextGE info needs to be passed back in the flow control?
    - can't easily recover from slave failures if you already started processing
        - unless you assume that the results from slave are always deterministic and can retry and skip N
    - potentially ties up a slave thread for a while 
        - do we need to have a larger thread pool but limit how many actually active?

3. Order of work
    - Just adding streaming while ignoring flow control and continuation stuff (i.e. we still stop for permission to continue periodically)
        - Shouldn't make anything any _worse_ ...
            - except that won't be able to recover from a slave dying mid-stream (at least not without some considerable effort)
                - what will happen then?
            - May also break server-side caching (that no-one has used AFAIK). Maybe restrict to nohits as we change....
    - Add some flow control
        - would prevent slave getting too far ahead in cases that are inadequately flow-controlled today
        - shouldn't make anything any worse...
    - Think about removing continuation mechanism from some cases

Per Gavin, streaming would definitely help for the lowest frequency term.  It may help for the others as well if it avoided any significant start up costs - e.g., opening the indexes,
creating the segment monitors, creating the various cursors, and serialising the context (especially because there are likely to be multiple cursors).

To add streaming:
    - Need to check for meta availability other than when first received
        - when ? 
    - Need to cope with a getNext() blocking without it causing issues
     - perhaps should recode getNext() of variable-size rows first?

More questions:
    - Can we afford the memory for the resend info?
        - Save maxPacketsPerSender per sender ?
    - are we really handling restart and sequence wraparound correctly?
    - what about server-side caching? Makes it hard
        - but maybe we should only cache tiny replies anyway....

Problems found while testing implemetnation:
    - the unpacker cursor read code is crap
    - there is a potential to deadlock when need to make a callback slave->server during a streamed result (indexread5 illustrates)
        - resolution callback code doesn't really need to be query specific - could go to the default handler
        - but other callbacks - ALIVE, EXCEPTION, and debugger are not so clear
    - It's not at all clear where to move the code for processing metadata
    - callback paradigm would solve both - but it has to be on a client thread (e.g. from within call to next()).

    The following are used in "pseudo callback" mode:
    #define ROXIE_DEBUGREQUEST 0x3ffffff7u
    #define ROXIE_DEBUGCALLBACK 0x3ffffff8u
    #define ROXIE_PING 0x3ffffff9u
        - goes to own handler anyway
    #define ROXIE_TRACEINFO 0x3ffffffau
        - could go in meta? Not time critical. Could all go to single handler? (a bit hard since we want to intercept for caller...)
    #define ROXIE_FILECALLBACK 0x3ffffffbu
        - could go to single handler
    #define ROXIE_ALIVE 0x3ffffffcu
        - currently getting delayed a bit too much potentially if downstream processing is slow? Do I even need it if streaming?
    #define ROXIE_KEYEDLIMIT_EXCEEDED 0x3ffffffdu
        - could go in metadata of standard response
    #define ROXIE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 0x3ffffffeu
        - ditto
    #define ROXIE_EXCEPTION   0x3fffffffu
        - ditto
    And the continuation metadata.

    What if EVERYTHING was a callback? - here's an exception... here's some more rows... here's some tracing... here's some continuation metadata
    Somewhere sometime I need to marshall from one thread to another though (maybe more than once unless I can guarantee callback is always very fast)

    OR (is it the same) everything is metadata ? Metadata can contain any of the above information (apart from rows - or maybe they are just another type)
    If I can't deal quickly with a packet of information, I queue it up? Spanning complicates things though. I need to be able to spot complete portions of metadata
    (and in kind-of the same way I need to be able to spot complete rows of data even when they span multiple packets.) I think data is really a bit different from the rest -
    you expect it to be continuous and you want the others to interrupt the flow.

    If continuation info was restricted to a "yes/no" (i.e. had to be continued on same node as started on) could have simple "Is there any continuation" bit. Others are sent in their 
    own packets so are a little different. Does that make it harder to recover? Not sure that it does really (just means that the window at which a failure causes a problem starts earlier).
    However it may be an issue tying up slave thread for a while (and do we know when to untie it if the Roxie server abandons/restarts?)

    Perhaps it makes sense to pause at this point (with streaming disabled and with retry mechanism optional)
